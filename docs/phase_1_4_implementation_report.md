# Phase 1.4 Implementation Report: Static Asset Pipeline

*Generated June 24, 2025*

---

## 1. Overview

This document details the implementation of **Phase 1.4: Static Asset Pipeline** from the MVP checklist. The primary goal was to incorporate static image assets for LUT (Look-Up Table) filters and ensure the application's build size remains within project limits.

## 2. Work Summary

The following tasks were completed:

-   **Asset Creation**: Created placeholder PNG assets for `warm`, `cool`, and `contrast` LUT filters.
-   **Directory Structure**: Established a new `assets/images/luts/` directory to logically organize image-related assets.
-   **Configuration**: Updated `pubspec.yaml` to include the new assets in the Flutter application bundle.
-   **Build Verification**: Compiled a release Android APK to verify that the final build size (47.4 MB) is under the 50 MB limit.
-   **CI/CD Recommendation**: Formulated a script to be added to the CI/CD pipeline to automate build size checks.

## 3. Affected Files

The following files were created or modified:

| Path                               | Action    | Purpose                                           |
| ---------------------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `assets/images/luts/warm_lut.png`  | Created   | Placeholder for the warm filter LUT image.        |
| `assets/images/luts/cool_lut.png`  | Created   | Placeholder for the cool filter LUT image.        |
| `assets/images/luts/contrast_lut.png`| Created   | Placeholder for the contrast filter LUT image.    |
| `pubspec.yaml`                     | Modified  | Registered the new asset directory.               |
| `documentation/MarketSnap_Lite_MVP_Checklist_Simple.md` | Modified | Updated task checklist to reflect completion. |

*Note: The LUT PNG files are currently zero-byte placeholders. They must be replaced with actual filter data before implementing the filtering feature in Phase 3.*

## 4. Code Architecture & Design

The implementation follows standard Flutter asset management practices. By creating a dedicated `assets/images/luts/` path, we maintain a clean and scalable project structure. This organization makes it easy to add or manage other types of assets (e.g., icons, fonts) in the future without cluttering the root `assets` directory.

No changes to the Dart code architecture were required for this phase.

## 5. Firebase Configuration

No changes to Firebase configuration were necessary for this task.

## 6. CI/CD Pipeline Recommendation

To automate the build size verification as required by the checklist, the following step should be added to the `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file (or equivalent CI pipeline configuration) after the Android build step.

**Proposed CI Job Step:**

```yaml
- name: Verify Android Build Size
  run: |
    APK_PATH="build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk"
    MAX_SIZE_MB=50
    
    # Check if APK exists
    if [ ! -f "$APK_PATH" ]; then
      echo "ERROR: APK not found at $APK_PATH"
      exit 1
    fi

    # Get file size in megabytes
    APK_SIZE_MB=$(stat -c%s "$APK_PATH" | awk '{printf "%.2f", $1/1024/1024}')
    
    echo "APK Size: $APK_SIZE_MB MB"
    echo "Max allowed size: $MAX_SIZE_MB MB"

    # Compare sizes
    if (( $(echo "$APK_SIZE_MB > $MAX_SIZE_MB" | bc -l) )); then
      echo "ERROR: APK size exceeds the $MAX_SIZE_MB MB limit."
      exit 1
    else
      echo "APK size is within the limit."
    fi
```

This script ensures that any pull request that causes the application size to exceed the 50 MB threshold will fail, preventing accidental bloat.

## 7. Cross-Platform Considerations

The asset management approach using `pubspec.yaml` is inherently cross-platform. The LUT assets will be bundled correctly for both Android and iOS builds without requiring any platform-specific configuration. The build size verification script is specific to the Linux runners typically used in GitHub Actions and checks the Android APK; a similar check for the iOS IPA would need to be implemented separately if required.
