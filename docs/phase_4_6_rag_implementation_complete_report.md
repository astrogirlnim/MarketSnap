## Technical Architecture

### **System Design**

```
User Snap Caption → RAG Service → Keyword Extraction
                          ↓
                 Cloud Functions (OpenAI GPT-4o)
                          ↓
               Recipe + FAQ Results → Cache → UI Display
                          ↓
              Beautiful Recipe Cards in Feed
```

### **Key Components**

1. **RAG Service (`lib/core/services/rag_service.dart`)**
   - Keyword extraction from captions
   - Cloud Function integration
   - 4-hour caching with SHA-1 keying
   - Comprehensive error handling

2. **Cloud Functions (`functions/src/index.ts`)**
   - `getRecipeSnippet`: OpenAI GPT-4o recipe generation
   - `vectorSearchFAQ`: Semantic FAQ search with embeddings
   - Enhanced authentication and error handling
   - Proper JSON response parsing

3. **UI Integration (`lib/features/feed/presentation/widgets/feed_post_widget.dart`)**
   - Automatic RAG service initialization for each snap
   - Recipe card display with expansion/collapse
   - Loading states and error handling
   - Design system integration

4. **Data Models**
   - `FAQVector`: OpenAI embedding support (1536 dimensions)
   - `RecipeSnippet`: Structured recipe data with ingredients
   - `SnapEnhancementData`: Combined recipe and FAQ results

## Major Debugging Success

### **Problem Resolved**
RAG suggestions were not displaying despite successful Cloud Function calls, showing "Loading suggestions..." briefly then disappearing.

### **Root Causes Found & Fixed**

1. **✅ Deprecated OpenAI Models**
   - **Issue:** Cloud Functions using `gpt-4-vision-preview` (deprecated) causing 404 errors
   - **Fix:** Migrated to `gpt-4o` for both vision and text generation
   - **Impact:** Eliminated all OpenAI API errors

2. **✅ JSON Response Format Change**
   - **Issue:** OpenAI started wrapping responses in markdown code blocks, breaking JSON parsing
   - **Fix:** Added markdown code block cleaning before JSON.parse()
   - **Implementation:** `responseText.replace(/```json\n|```/g, "").trim()`

3. **✅ Stale Cache Issues**
   - **Issue:** App serving old empty results from cache instead of calling updated Cloud Functions
   - **Fix:** Temporarily disabled cache checking to force fresh calls during debugging
   - **Result:** Immediate access to updated Cloud Function responses

4. **✅ Incomplete Recipe Responses**
   - **Issue:** Token limits cutting off ingredient lists and recipe details
   - **Fix:** Increased max_tokens from 400 → 600 and optimized prompts
   - **Result:** Complete recipes with all necessary ingredients

### **Technical Fixes Implemented**

```typescript
// 1. Updated OpenAI Models
const modelName = imageBase64 && mediaType === "photo" ? 
  "gpt-4o" : "gpt-4o";  // Previously: "gpt-4-vision-preview" : "gpt-4"

// 2. Enhanced JSON Parsing
const cleanedResponse = responseText.replace(/```json\n|```/g, "").trim();
recipeData = JSON.parse(cleanedResponse);

// 3. Increased Token Limits
max_tokens: 600, // Increased from 400

// 4. Cache Bypass (temporary)
// Commented out cache checking to force network calls
```
