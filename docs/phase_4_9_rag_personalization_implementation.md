## Technical Implementation

### 1. UserInterests Model (`lib/core/models/user_interests.dart`)

**Comprehensive User Behavior Tracking:**
- **Keywords:** Preferred terms with relevance scores and interaction counts
- **Categories:** Product categories with weighted preferences
- **Content Types:** Balanced, detailed, or quick content preferences
- **Engagement Metrics:** Satisfaction score, engagement rate, confidence levels
- **Temporal Data:** Recent search terms, favorite vendors, interaction history

**Key Features:**
- Automatic limits (10 keywords, 5 categories, 20 search terms, 10 vendors)
- Weighted average relevance scoring
- Confidence-based personalization thresholds
- Firestore serialization with proper data types

### 2. RAGPersonalizationService (`lib/core/services/rag_personalization_service.dart`)

**Core Functionality:**
- **User Interest Management:** Load, cache (2-hour TTL), and update user interests
- **Feedback Processing:** Automatic interest updates from user interactions
- **Enhanced Preferences:** Combines traditional feedback with stored interests
- **Content Ranking:** Sophisticated preference-based ranking algorithm
- **Analytics Support:** Comprehensive metrics and statistics tracking

**Caching Strategy:**
- 2-hour TTL for user interests to balance performance and freshness
- Non-blocking operations to avoid affecting core functionality
- Graceful degradation when personalization data unavailable

### 3. Enhanced RAGService (`lib/core/services/rag_service.dart`)

**Integration Points:**
- **Enhanced User Preferences:** Combines feedback history with stored interests
- **Personalized Ranking:** FAQ results ranked by user preference relevance
- **Dual Feedback Processing:** Traditional + personalization feedback paths
- **Account Deletion Support:** Complete user data cleanup

### 4. Cloud Functions Enhancement (`functions/src/index.ts`)

**Enhanced AI Prompts:**
- **Recipe Generation:** User preferences, satisfaction scores, and content type preferences
- **FAQ Search:** Preference boosting and confidence-weighted personalization
- **Adaptive Prompting:** Different approaches based on personalization confidence levels

## Key Features

### üéØ Personalization Engine

**Confidence Scoring System:**
- Interaction count weight (40%)
- Satisfaction score weight (40%) 
- Engagement rate weight (20%)
- Minimum 5 interactions for significant data threshold

**Content Ranking Algorithm:**
```dart
double rankContentByPreferences(Map<String, dynamic> content, Map<String, dynamic> preferences) {
  // Base relevance + keyword bonuses + category bonuses + vendor bonuses
  // With confidence weighting and preference strength modulation
}
```

### üìä User Behavior Analytics

**Tracked Metrics:**
- Total interactions, positive/negative feedback counts
- Keyword and category interaction patterns
- Recent search history and vendor preferences
- Engagement rates and satisfaction scores

**Limits and Management:**
- Automatic keyword pruning (top 10 by interaction count)
- Category preference limits (top 5 by relevance)
- Recent search terms rolling window (20 items)
- Favorite vendor tracking (10 most recent positive interactions)

### üîÑ Feedback Integration

**Automatic Interest Updates:**
- Recipe suggestion feedback ‚Üí keyword/category preferences
- FAQ interaction feedback ‚Üí search pattern learning
- Vendor interaction feedback ‚Üí vendor preference tracking
- Content type feedback ‚Üí presentation preference learning
