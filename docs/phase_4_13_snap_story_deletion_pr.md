## üß™ **Testing & Verification**

### **Quality Assurance Complete:**
- ‚úÖ **Static Analysis:** Flutter analyze reports 0 issues
- ‚úÖ **Unit Tests:** All existing tests continue to pass (11/11)
- ‚úÖ **Build Verification:** Debug APK builds successfully without errors
- ‚úÖ **Manual Testing:** Delete functionality verified with Firebase emulators

### **Test Scenarios Verified:**
1. **User Authentication:** Delete buttons only appear for authenticated users' own content
2. **Feed Post Deletion:** Single snap deletion from feed works correctly with confirmation
3. **Story Deletion:** Multi-snap story deletion handles batch operations with progress tracking
4. **Error Scenarios:** Failed deletions show appropriate error messages with retry functionality

6. **Cross-Platform:** Consistent behavior verified on Android and iOS simulators

### **How to Test:**

**Prerequisites:**
1. Run Firebase emulators: `./dev_emulator.sh`
2. Launch app with `flutter run`
3. Sign in with any authentication method
4. Create test content via camera (photos/videos)

**Testing Feed Post Deletion:**
1. Navigate to Feed tab
2. Look for red delete button (üóëÔ∏è) in header of YOUR posts only
3. Tap delete button ‚Üí confirmation dialog appears
4. Confirm deletion ‚Üí loading spinner ‚Üí success message
5. Verify post disappears from feed immediately

**Testing Story Deletion:**
1. Navigate to Feed tab with story carousel visible
2. Long-press on YOUR story (shows blue "Your story" badge)
3. Confirmation dialog for story deletion appears
4. Confirm deletion ‚Üí progress tracking for multi-snap stories
5. Verify story disappears from carousel immediately
