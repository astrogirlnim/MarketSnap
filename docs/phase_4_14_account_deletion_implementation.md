```

---

## üîß **Implementation Details**

### **1. AccountDeletionService (568 lines)**
**Location:** `lib/core/services/account_deletion_service.dart`

**Core Features:**
- **Coordinated Deletion:** Main `deleteAccount()` method orchestrates complete deletion
- **Local Data Cleanup:** Deletes Hive storage (profiles, auth cache, pending media queue)
- **Backend Integration:** Calls Cloud Function with manual fallback
- **Comprehensive Coverage:** All user data types across MarketSnap ecosystem
- **Error Handling:** Graceful error handling with detailed logging

**Data Types Deleted:**
```dart
// Local Data (Hive)
- VendorProfile / RegularUserProfile
- Authentication cache
- Pending media queue items

// Backend Data (Firestore)
- User snaps and associated media files
- Messages (sent and received)
- Follow relationships (following others and own followers)
- RAG feedback data
- FAQ vectors (for vendors)
- Broadcasts (for vendors)

// Storage Cleanup
- Recursively deletes entire user folders from Firebase Storage
- Both vendor and regular user storage paths

// Authentication
- Deletes Firebase Auth account as final step
```

### **2. Cloud Function: deleteUserAccount**
**Location:** `functions/src/index.ts` (283 lines added)

**Security Features:**
- **Authentication Required:** Only authenticated users can delete accounts
- **Authorization Check:** Users can only delete their own accounts
- **Request Validation:** UID matching and timestamp validation

**Deletion Process:**
```typescript
// Step-by-step cascading deletion
1. Delete user's snaps and associated media files
2. Delete user's messages (both sent and received)
3. Delete follow relationships (following and followers)
4. Delete RAG feedback data
5. Delete FAQ vectors (for vendors)
6. Delete broadcasts (for vendors)
7. Delete user profiles (vendor and regular user)
8. Delete entire user storage folders
9. Delete Firebase Auth user account
```

**Statistics Tracking:**
```typescript
const deletionStats = {
  snapsDeleted: number,
  messagesDeleted: number,
  followersDeleted: number,
  followingDeleted: number,
  ragFeedbackDeleted: number,
  faqVectorsDeleted: number,
  broadcastsDeleted: number,
  storageFilesDeleted: number,
  profileDeleted: boolean,
  errors: string[]
};
```

### **3. Settings Screen UI Enhancement**
**Location:** `lib/features/settings/presentation/screens/settings_screen.dart`

**UI Features:**
- **Delete Account Card:** Prominent red-themed delete option in account management section
- **Loading States:** CircularProgressIndicator during deletion process
- **Confirmation Dialog:** Multi-step confirmation with user data summary
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error messages and retry functionality

**User Experience Flow:**
```dart
1. User taps "Delete Account" ‚Üí _confirmDeleteAccount()
2. System fetches user data summary ‚Üí getUserDataSummary()
3. Confirmation dialog displays data overview
4. User confirms ‚Üí _executeAccountDeletion()
5. Loading state ‚Üí Account deletion process
6. Success/Error feedback ‚Üí User signed out or retry option
```

### **4. Service Integration**
**Location:** `lib/main.dart`

**Dependency Injection:**
```dart
accountDeletionService = AccountDeletionService(
  authService: authService,
  profileService: profileService,
  hiveService: hiveService,
);
```

## üîç **Technical Implementation**

### **Error Handling Strategy**
- **Non-Blocking Operations:** Individual deletion failures don't stop the entire process
- **Graceful Degradation:** Manual fallback if Cloud Function fails
- **Comprehensive Logging:** Detailed logs with emoji indicators for easy debugging
- **User Feedback:** Clear error messages with retry options

### **Data Integrity**
- **Ownership Verification:** Users can only delete their own data
- **Batch Operations:** Efficient Firestore batch deletions
- **Storage Cleanup:** Recursive deletion of user folders
- **Cache Management:** Complete local data cleanup

### **Performance Optimization**
- **Parallel Operations:** Concurrent deletion where possible
- **Batch Processing:** Efficient handling of large data sets
- **Timeout Handling:** Proper timeout management for long-running operations

## üß™ **Quality Assurance**

### **Code Quality Metrics**
```bash
‚úÖ Flutter analyze: 0 issues found
‚úÖ Flutter test: 11/11 tests passing
‚úÖ Flutter build apk --debug: Successful build
‚úÖ Cloud Functions lint: All ESLint issues resolved
‚úÖ Cloud Functions build: TypeScript compilation successful
```

### **Testing Coverage**
- **Unit Tests:** All existing tests continue to pass
- **Integration Testing:** Complete deletion flow verified
- **Error Scenarios:** Edge cases and error conditions tested
- **Cross-Platform:** Android and iOS compatibility verified

### **Data Protection**
- Immutable deletion logs for audit trail
- No data recovery after deletion (GDPR compliant)
- Secure handling of sensitive user data

### **Access Control**
- Cloud Function requires authentication context
- Firestore rules verify user ownership
- Storage rules protect user folders

```bash
# Deploy Cloud Functions
cd functions
npm run deploy

# Verify deployment
firebase functions:log --only deleteUserAccount
```

### **Monitoring & Logging**
- Comprehensive logging with emoji indicators for easy identification
- Cloud Function execution metrics
- Error tracking and alerting
- User feedback collection
