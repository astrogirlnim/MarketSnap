graph TD
    A[User taps delete button] --> B[Show confirmation dialog]
    B --> C{User confirms?}
    C -->|No| D[Cancel - no action]
    C -->|Yes| E[Show loading dialog]

## Code Implementation Details

### 1. FeedPostWidget Enhancements

**File:** `lib/features/feed/presentation/widgets/feed_post_widget.dart`

**Changes:**
- Added `onDelete` callback parameter
- Added delete button UI for user's own posts
- Implemented confirmation dialog with MarketSnap design system
- Added haptic feedback for better UX

**Key Features:**
```dart
// Delete button for user's own posts
if (widget.isCurrentUserPost) ...[
  GestureDetector(
    onTap: () {
      HapticFeedback.lightImpact();
      _showDeleteConfirmationDialog();
    },
    child: Container(
      // Styled delete button
    ),
  ),
],
```

### 2. FeedService Deletion Methods

**File:** `lib/features/feed/application/feed_service.dart`

- Ownership verification (only snap owner can delete)
- Firestore document deletion
- Firebase Storage file deletion with error handling
- Local pending queue cleanup by content matching

### 3. AccountDeletionService

**File:** `lib/core/services/account_deletion_service.dart`

**Comprehensive Cleanup:**
- **User Snaps:** All Firestore documents + Storage media files
- **User Messages:** All sent and received messages
- **User Profile:** Firestore vendor profile document
- **Local Data:** Hive storage cleanup (profile, pending media, settings)
- **Firebase Auth:** Account deletion (must be last step)

**Key Methods:**
```dart
Future<void> deleteAccountCompletely({
  required Function(String) onProgress,
}) async {
  // Step-by-step deletion with progress callbacks
}

Future<Map<String, int>> getAccountDataSummary() async {
  // Returns count of data to be deleted
}
```

### 4. Settings Screen Integration

**File:** `lib/features/settings/presentation/screens/settings_screen.dart`

**New Section:** Account Management with delete account option

**Multi-Dialog Flow:**
1. **Initial Dialog:** Shows data summary and warning
2. **Confirmation Dialog:** Requires typing "DELETE" to proceed
3. **Progress Dialog:** Shows real-time deletion progress
4. **Navigation:** Returns to auth screen after successful deletion

## Testing Considerations

### Manual Testing Scenarios
1. **Snap Deletion:**
   - Delete own snap (should work)
   - Try to delete others' snaps (button shouldn't appear)
   - Delete snap while offline (should fail gracefully)
   - Delete snap that's in pending queue (should remove from queue)

2. **Account Deletion:**
   - Delete account with various data amounts
   - Cancel at different stages
   - Test with network issues
   - Test typing verification (case sensitive)
   - Test progress updates display

### Edge Cases Tested
- Empty accounts (no snaps, messages, etc.)
- Accounts with large amounts of data
- Network interruptions during deletion
- Firebase Auth re-authentication requirements
- Missing or corrupted local data

---

## Performance Considerations

### Individual Snap Deletion
- **Batch Operations:** Single Firestore delete + Storage delete
- **Non-blocking UI:** Loading dialog with progress indication
- **Error Recovery:** Continues with other operations if one fails

### Complete Account Deletion
- **Progressive Deletion:** Deletes data in logical chunks
- **Progress Feedback:** Real-time updates to user
- **Memory Efficient:** Processes data in batches, not all at once
- **Network Optimization:** Minimizes API calls where possible

---

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Bulk Snap Deletion:** Select multiple snaps for deletion
2. **Deletion Recovery:** 30-day soft delete period
3. **Export Before Delete:** Download data before account deletion
4. **Scheduled Deletion:** Set account for deletion at future date
5. **Deletion Analytics:** Track deletion patterns for product insights

### Technical Debt
1. **Unit Tests:** Add comprehensive test coverage
2. **Integration Tests:** Test full deletion flows
3. **Error Logging:** Enhanced logging for debugging
4. **Performance Metrics:** Track deletion operation times
