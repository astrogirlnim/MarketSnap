# OTP Verification Fix & Account Linking Implementation

## Overview
This document details the fixes implemented to resolve OTP verification issues and the new account linking system to prevent multiple vendor profiles per user.

---

## Issues Resolved

### 1. **OTP Verification "Invalid Code" Error**
**Problem**: Users were getting "Invalid verification code" errors even when using the correct codes from Firebase emulator terminal.

**Root Cause**: When users clicked "Resend" for OTP codes, Firebase Auth generated a new `verificationId`, but the OTP verification screen continued using the original `verificationId` from when the screen was first created.

**Impact**: Made phone authentication unusable after resending codes.

### 2. **Multiple Vendor Profiles Per User**
**Problem**: Different authentication methods (Google vs Phone) created separate vendor profiles for the same person.

**Root Cause**: Each auth method generates different Firebase Auth UIDs, so the app treated them as different users.

**Impact**: Users had to recreate their vendor profile when switching between auth methods.

### 3. **Sign-Out Spinner Issue**
**Problem**: Sign-out button would spin indefinitely without completing.

**Root Cause**: Firebase Auth emulator connection timeouts without proper error handling.

**Impact**: Users couldn't sign out to test different authentication flows.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. **OTP Verification Fix**

#### **File**: `lib/features/auth/presentation/screens/otp_verification_screen.dart`

**Changes**:
- Added mutable `_currentVerificationId` variable to track active verification session
- Updated `initState()` to initialize with widget's verification ID
- Enhanced `_resendOTP()` method to update verification ID when new code is sent
- Added comprehensive logging to track verification ID changes
- Automatic clearing of OTP input fields when new code is sent
- Improved focus management during resend flow

**Key Code Changes**:
```dart
// Store the current verification ID (can be updated when OTP is resent)
late String _currentVerificationId;

@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();
  // Initialize with the verification ID passed from the previous screen
  _currentVerificationId = widget.verificationId;
  debugPrint('[OTPVerificationScreen] Initial verification ID: $_currentVerificationId');
  // ... rest of initialization
}

// In _resendOTP() method:
codeSent: (verificationId, resendToken) {
  debugPrint('[OTPVerificationScreen] Old verification ID: $_currentVerificationId');
  debugPrint('[OTPVerificationScreen] New verification ID: $verificationId');
  
  setState(() {
    _isResending = false;
    // Update the verification ID to the new one
    _currentVerificationId = verificationId;
  });
  
  // Clear any existing OTP input
  for (final controller in _otpControllers) {
    controller.clear();
  }
  _otpFocusNodes[0].requestFocus();
}
```

#### **File**: `lib/features/auth/application/auth_service.dart`

**Enhanced Error Handling**:
- Added specific error messages for different OTP verification failures
- Enhanced logging with verification ID tracking
- Better timeout handling for sign-out operations

**Key Code Changes**:
```dart
Future<UserCredential> verifyOTPAndSignIn({
  required String verificationId,
  required String smsCode,
}) async {
  debugPrint('[AuthService] Verifying OTP: $smsCode with verification ID: $verificationId');

  try {
    // Enhanced error handling for specific OTP verification errors
    switch (e.code) {
      case 'invalid-verification-code':
        throw Exception('The verification code is invalid. Please check the code and try again.');
      case 'invalid-verification-id':
        throw Exception('The verification session has expired. Please request a new code.');
      case 'session-expired':
        throw Exception('The verification session has expired. Please request a new code.');
      default:
        throw Exception(_getPhoneAuthErrorMessage(e));
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. **Account Linking System**

#### **File**: `lib/core/services/account_linking_service.dart`

**New Service**: Created comprehensive account linking service to prevent multiple vendor profiles.

**Features**:
- Automatic account linking based on shared phone numbers or email addresses
- Profile consolidation when accounts are linked
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Integration with existing authentication flow

**Key Methods**:
```dart
class AccountLinkingService {
  /// Handles account linking after user signs in
  Future<void> handleSignInAccountLinking()
  
  /// Finds existing profiles by phone number
  Future<VendorProfile?> findProfileByPhoneNumber(String phoneNumber)
  
  /// Finds existing profiles by email address  
  Future<VendorProfile?> findProfileByEmail(String email)
  
  /// Consolidates two vendor profiles into one
  Future<VendorProfile> consolidateProfiles(VendorProfile primary, VendorProfile secondary)
}
```

#### **File**: `lib/core/models/vendor_profile.dart`

**Model Updates**:
- Added `phoneNumber` and `email` fields to VendorProfile
- Updated Hive type annotations for new fields
- Regenerated type adapters with `build_runner`

**New Fields**:
```dart
@HiveField(7)
String? phoneNumber;

@HiveField(8) 
String? email;
```

#### **File**: `lib/main.dart`

**Integration**:
- Added AccountLinkingService initialization
- Integrated account linking into authentication flow
- Updated Firestore emulator port from 8080 to 8081
- Enhanced error handling in AuthWrapper

### 3. **Sign-Out Fix**

**Enhanced AuthService**:
- Added 10-second timeout to prevent infinite spinning
- Improved error handling with specific timeout and network error messages
- Better user feedback with descriptive error messages

## Usage Instructions

### **For OTP Verification**
1. Enter phone number (+1234567890 for testing)
2. Wait for code to appear in Firebase emulator terminal
3. If resending, use the **new** code that appears after resend
4. App will automatically use the correct verification ID

### **For Account Linking**
1. Sign in with one method (e.g., Google)
2. Create vendor profile
3. Sign out and sign in with different method (e.g., Phone)
4. Account linking service will detect and prevent duplicate profile creation

### **For Troubleshooting**
- Monitor Flutter debug console for detailed logging
- Check Firebase emulator terminal for OTP codes
- Look for verification ID change messages during resend
- Use Firebase emulator UI at http://127.0.0.1:4000/ for user management

## Future Enhancements

### **Planned Improvements**
1. **Complete Account Linking Integration**: Full testing with multiple auth methods
2. **Profile Migration**: Automatic migration of existing duplicate profiles
3. **Enhanced User Feedback**: Better UI indicators for account linking status
4. **Batch Operations**: Efficient handling of multiple profile consolidations

### **Monitoring & Analytics**
1. Track account linking success rates
2. Monitor OTP verification failure patterns
3. Analyze authentication method preferences
4. Performance metrics for verification flows
