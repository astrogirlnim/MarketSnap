### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Changes

#### CameraService Extensions (`lib/features/capture/application/camera_service.dart`)
**New Properties:**
```dart
// Video recording state management
bool _isRecordingVideo = false;
Timer? _recordingTimer;
int _recordingDuration = 0;
static const int _maxRecordingDuration = 5; // 5 seconds max
StreamController<int>? _countdownController;
```

**New Methods:**
- `startVideoRecording()` - Initiates video recording with countdown
- `stopVideoRecording()` - Stops recording and saves video file
- `cancelVideoRecording()` - Cancels recording without saving
- `_startSimulatorVideoRecording()` - Simulator mode video recording
- `_stopSimulatorVideoRecording()` - Simulator mode video completion
- `_cleanupVideoRecording()` - Resource cleanup and state reset

**Key Features:**
- Automatic 5-second timer with countdown stream
- Cross-platform video file management
- Simulator mode with mock video creation
- Proper resource cleanup and error handling
- Audio recording enabled for video capture

#### UI Enhancements (`lib/features/capture/presentation/screens/camera_preview_screen.dart`)
**New State Management:**
```dart
// Video recording state
bool _isRecordingVideo = false;
int _recordingCountdown = 0;
StreamSubscription<int>? _countdownSubscription;
```

**New UI Components:**
- `_buildRecordingCountdown()` - Live countdown display with pulsing indicator
- `_buildMainCaptureButton()` - Adaptive button (photo/video/stop modes)
- `_buildModeSelector()` - Photo/Video mode selector
- Enhanced camera controls layout with video functionality

**Visual Features:**
- Real-time countdown display with "REC X" format
- Pulsing recording indicator animation
- Red recording button with stop icon during recording
- Mode selector showing "Video (5s)" option
- Cancel button during recording
- Success/error feedback via SnackBar

### üîß Technical Implementation

#### Video Recording Flow
1. **Start Recording:**
   - User taps video recording button
   - `CameraService.startVideoRecording()` called
   - Camera controller starts video recording
   - Timer starts with 1-second intervals
   - Countdown stream broadcasts remaining time
   - UI updates with recording indicator

2. **During Recording:**
   - Timer counts up from 0 to 5 seconds
   - Countdown stream emits remaining time (5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0)
   - UI displays "REC X" with pulsing indicator
   - User can manually stop or cancel recording

3. **Stop Recording:**
   - Automatic stop at 5 seconds OR manual stop
   - Camera controller stops recording
   - Video file saved to app documents/videos directory
   - Timer and streams cleaned up
   - UI resets to normal state
   - Success feedback shown to user

#### File Management
- **Video Storage:** `{app_documents}/videos/marketsnap_video_{timestamp}.mp4`
- **Simulator Mode:** Creates mock video file with metadata
- **Cleanup:** Temporary files automatically deleted
- **Error Handling:** Proper cleanup on recording failures

#### Cross-Platform Considerations
- **iOS:** Full video recording support with audio
- **Android:** Full video recording support with audio
- **Simulator:** Mock video creation for development testing
- **Audio:** Enabled in camera controller for video recording

### üé® User Interface

#### Recording State Indicators
- **Normal State:** Red video button in mode selector
- **Recording State:** Red capture button with stop icon
- **Countdown Display:** "REC 5", "REC 4", "REC 3", "REC 2", "REC 1"
- **Recording Indicator:** Pulsing white dot animation
- **Cancel Option:** X button in countdown display

#### Mode Selector
- **Photo Mode:** Camera icon + "Photo" text
- **Video Mode:** Video icon + "Video (5s)" text (highlighted in red)
- **Responsive:** Adapts to recording state

#### Feedback System
- **Success:** Green SnackBar with checkmark and duration
- **Error:** Red SnackBar with error icon and message
- **Cancel:** Orange SnackBar with cancel icon

### üß™ Testing

#### Manual Testing Checklist
- [X] **Start Recording:** Tap video button starts 5-second recording
- [X] **Countdown Display:** Shows "REC 5" down to "REC 1"
- [X] **Auto Stop:** Recording automatically stops at 5 seconds
- [X] **Manual Stop:** Tap stop button ends recording early
- [X] **Cancel Recording:** Tap X cancels without saving
- [X] **File Creation:** Video files saved to app directory
- [X] **Simulator Mode:** Mock video creation works
- [X] **Cross-Platform:** Works on both iOS and Android
- [X] **Error Handling:** Proper error messages and cleanup
- [X] **State Management:** UI properly resets after recording

#### Development Testing
```bash
# Run development emulators
./scripts/dev_emulator.sh

# Test on iOS Simulator
# Test on Android Emulator
# Verify console logs for video recording events
# Check app documents directory for saved videos
```

#### Expected Console Output
```
[CameraService] Starting video recording...
[CameraService] Video recording started successfully
[CameraService] Recording duration: 1 seconds
[CameraService] Recording duration: 2 seconds
...
[CameraService] Maximum recording duration reached, stopping...
[CameraService] Video recorded successfully
[CameraService] Video path: /path/to/videos/marketsnap_video_timestamp.mp4
```

### üì± Firebase Emulator Compatibility
- **No Firebase dependencies** for video recording functionality
- **Local file storage** in app documents directory
- **Future integration** ready for Firebase Storage upload
- **Emulator testing** fully supported

### üîÑ Integration Points

#### Future Phase 4 Integration
- **Media Queue:** Videos ready for offline queue processing
- **Firebase Storage:** Upload path prepared in video file structure
- **Compression:** Video files ready for compression pipeline
- **Metadata:** Timestamp and duration tracking implemented

#### Existing Integration
- **Authentication:** Works with existing auth bypass for development
- **Camera Service:** Seamlessly integrated with photo capture
- **UI Framework:** Consistent with existing camera interface
- **Error Handling:** Uses established error feedback patterns

### üêõ Known Issues & Limitations
- **Simulator Mode:** Creates text file instead of actual MP4 (expected)
- **File Size:** No compression applied yet (Phase 4 feature)
- **Storage Cleanup:** No automatic cleanup of old videos (future enhancement)
- **Background Recording:** Stops if app goes to background (platform limitation)

### üöÄ Performance Considerations
- **Memory Usage:** Proper cleanup of timers and streams
- **File I/O:** Efficient video file management
- **UI Updates:** Optimized state management during recording
- **Resource Cleanup:** Comprehensive disposal methods

### üìã Code Quality
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive try-catch blocks
- **Logging:** Detailed debug output for troubleshooting
- **State Management:** Clean separation of concerns
- **Cross-Platform:** Consistent behavior across platforms
- **Documentation:** Extensive inline comments

## Conclusion
The 5-second video recording feature has been successfully implemented with full cross-platform support, comprehensive error handling, and excellent user experience. The implementation is ready for Phase 4 integration with media queue processing and Firebase Storage upload functionality.
