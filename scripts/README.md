### `dev_emulator.sh` - Dual Platform Development Environment

**Enhanced Development Script v2.0** - Launches both iOS and Android emulators simultaneously and runs the Flutter app on both platforms for parallel development and testing with optimized performance and robust error handling.

#### üéØ What it does:

1. **Prerequisites Check**: Verifies Flutter, Android SDK, Xcode, and project setup
2. **Environment Setup**: Configures Android SDK paths and environment variables
3. **Smart Emulator Launch**: Intelligent iOS Simulator detection and fast Android Emulator startup
4. **Robust App Deployment**: Advanced Flutter app deployment with multi-pattern device detection
5. **Real-time Process Monitoring**: Enhanced monitoring with status updates and helpful tips
6. **Comprehensive Cleanup**: Proper simulator shutdown and complete process termination

#### üîß Requirements:

- **Flutter SDK** (3.8.1 or higher)
- **Xcode** with iOS Simulator
- **Android Studio** with Android SDK
- **Android Emulator**: `Medium_Phone_API_36.0` (or modify script for your AVD)
- **Environment File**: `.env` with Firebase configuration

#### üì± Supported Emulators:

- **iOS**: `apple_ios_simulator` (iPhone 16 Pro default)
- **Android**: `Medium_Phone_API_36.0` (customizable)

#### üéÆ Usage:

```bash
# Basic usage - launch both platforms
./scripts/dev_emulator.sh

# The script will:
# ‚úÖ Check all prerequisites
# üçé Launch iOS Simulator
# ü§ñ Launch Android Emulator
# üì± Deploy Flutter app to both platforms
# üìä Show real-time status updates
# üîÑ Enable hot reload on both platforms

# To stop everything, press CTRL+C
# The script will automatically cleanup all processes
```

#### üìã Process Flow:

    I --> J[Monitor Both Processes]
    J --> K[Handle CTRL+C]
    K --> L[Cleanup All Processes]
    L --> M[Exit Gracefully]
```

#### üìù Log Files:

The script generates detailed log files for debugging:

- `scripts/flutter_ios.log` - iOS Flutter app logs
- `scripts/flutter_android.log` - Android Flutter app logs
- Console output - Real-time status and process monitoring

#### üé® Enhanced Features:

- **üåà Colored Console Output**: Different colors for different log levels (INFO, SUCCESS, WARNING, ERROR)
- **‚è∞ Timestamped Logs**: All log entries include precise timestamps for debugging
- **üîÑ Hot Reload Support**: Both platforms support hot reload during development
- **üìä Real-time Monitoring**: Enhanced status updates every 10 seconds with device detection
- **üßπ Comprehensive Cleanup**: Proper iOS Simulator shutdown + complete process termination
- **‚ö° Fast Android Boot**: Optimized startup (~30 seconds) with smart boot detection
- **üîß Robust Device Detection**: Multi-pattern Flutter device ID recognition with fallbacks
- **üìù Live Logging**: Real-time logs with `tee` output to both console and files
- **üéØ Smart iOS Handling**: Automatic booted simulator detection or intelligent selection
- **üõ°Ô∏è Error Resilience**: Enhanced error handling with graceful degradation

#### üÜï Recent Improvements (v2.0):

**‚úÖ iOS Simulator Cleanup Fixed**
- Proper `xcrun simctl shutdown` command usage
- Complete process termination (both simulator app and instance)
- No more leftover iOS Simulator processes after script exit

**‚ö° Android Emulator Speed Boost**
- Reduced boot timeout from 180 to 30 seconds
- Removed `-wipe-data` flag for faster startup
- Multi-layered boot completion detection
- Enhanced ADB connection verification

**üéØ Robust Flutter Deployment**
- Multi-pattern device ID detection with fallbacks
- Better Flutter device recognition timing
- Real-time log output with `tee` command
- Process validation after deployment start
- Enhanced error handling with graceful degradation

**üìä Enhanced Monitoring**
- Device detection status in monitoring loop
- Periodic helpful tips during long-running processes
- Better process health verification
- Comprehensive cleanup verification

#### üõ†Ô∏è Customization:

Edit the script variables to customize for your setup:

```bash
# Emulator configurations
IOS_EMULATOR_ID="apple_ios_simulator"          # Your iOS simulator ID
ANDROID_EMULATOR_ID="Medium_Phone_API_36.0"    # Your Android AVD name
IOS_DEVICE_NAME="iPhone 16 Pro"                # Preferred iOS device
ANDROID_PORT="5554"                             # Android emulator port
ANDROID_SDK_PATH="$HOME/Library/Android/sdk"   # Android SDK path
```

#### üö® Troubleshooting:

**Common Issues:**

1. **Android Emulator Not Found**
   ```bash
   # List available AVDs
   $HOME/Library/Android/sdk/emulator/emulator -list-avds
   
   # Update ANDROID_EMULATOR_ID in script with your AVD name
   ```

2. **iOS Simulator Issues**
   ```bash
   # Reset iOS Simulator
   xcrun simctl erase all
   
   # List available simulators
   xcrun simctl list devices
   ```

3. **Flutter Environment Issues**
   ```bash
   # Check Flutter environment
   flutter doctor -v
   
   # Clean Flutter cache
   flutter clean
   flutter pub get
   ```

4. **Permission Issues**
   ```bash
   # Make script executable
   chmod +x scripts/dev_emulator.sh
   ```

#### üí° Tips & Best Practices:

- **Hot Reload**: Press `r` in either Flutter console to hot reload
- **Hot Restart**: Press `R` in either Flutter console to hot restart  
- **Live Log Monitoring**: Use `tail -f scripts/flutter_ios.log` and `tail -f scripts/flutter_android.log`
- **Fast Iteration**: Android emulator optimized for 30-second boot time
- **Multiple Terminals**: Open additional terminals to interact with each platform separately
- **Performance Optimization**: Close other applications to free up resources for emulators
- **Simulator Management**: iOS Simulator automatically detects booted devices or boots preferred one
- **Cleanup Testing**: Use CTRL+C to test cleanup functionality - all processes should terminate
- **Device Detection**: Script waits for Flutter to recognize both devices before app deployment

#### üîê Security:

- The script automatically loads environment variables from `.env`
- Firebase configuration is loaded securely at runtime
- No hardcoded secrets in the script
- Process isolation for each platform

#### üìä Performance Monitoring & Optimizations:

**Real-time Monitoring:**
- Process status (Running/Stopped) with PID tracking
- Flutter device recognition status  
- Emulator boot progress with time estimates
- Log file locations and monitoring tips

**Performance Optimizations:**
- **Fast Android Boot**: 30-second timeout vs previous 180 seconds
- **Smart iOS Detection**: Reuses already booted simulators
- **Optimized Emulator Settings**: No data wipe, GPU acceleration, no boot animation
- **Enhanced Device Detection**: Multi-pattern recognition with intelligent fallbacks
- **Live Process Validation**: Verifies Flutter processes are actually running after start

**Monitoring Features:**
- Device detection status every 60 seconds
- Helpful tips shown periodically during monitoring
- Real-time log output with `tee` for both console and file logging
- Comprehensive process health checks with automatic cleanup
