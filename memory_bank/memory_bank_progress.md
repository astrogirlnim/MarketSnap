# Progress (Status)

## What Works
- Background sync (WorkManager) is complete and production-ready on both Android and iOS.
  - Android: Fully functional, in-app verification available.
  - iOS: Fully functional, but requires manual log verification due to platform limitations.
- All test UI and debug buttons have been removed from the frontend.

## What's Left
- Continue with next checklist items (static asset pipeline, etc.)

## Known Issues
- iOS: Background task execution cannot be tracked in-app due to platform restrictions; must check logs for confirmation.
