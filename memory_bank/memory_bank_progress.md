# Progress (Status)

## What Works
- Background sync (WorkManager) is complete and production-ready on both Android and iOS.
  - Android: Fully functional, in-app verification available.
  - iOS: Fully functional, but requires manual log verification due to platform limitations.
- All test UI and debug buttons have been removed from the frontend.

## What's Left
- Continue with next checklist items (static asset pipeline, etc.)

## Known Issues
- iOS: Background task execution cannot be tracked in-app due to platform restrictions; must check logs for confirmation.

## Completed
- Project Brief, Product Context, System & Tech docs drafted.
- Detailed PRD v1.1 delivered.
- MVP checklist (list format) saved.

## In Progress
- Phase 1 tasks: project scaffold, Firebase setup, Hive queue.

## To Do
- Finish Phase 1 subtasks (WorkManager, assets).
- Begin Phase 2 schema + security rules once Foundation passes CI.

## Known Issues / Risks
- Video compression performance on older devices not yet profiled.
- Vector DB cost evaluation pending provider selection.
