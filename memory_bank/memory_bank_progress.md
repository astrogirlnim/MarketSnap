# Progress Log

*Last Updated: June 25, 2025*

## What Works

-   **Phase 1 - Foundation:** âœ… **COMPLETE**
    -   Flutter project created and all core dependencies are installed.
    -   Firebase SDKs are configured for both Android and iOS.
    -   Local data stores (Hive) and background job framework (WorkManager) are in place.
    -   Background sync fully functional on both platforms (iOS requires console log verification).

-   **Phase 2 - Data Layer:** ðŸ”„ **IN PROGRESS - Phase 2.3 Complete**
    -   **âœ… Firestore Schema & Security:** Database schema and security rules are defined and tested.
    -   **âœ… Storage Security & TTL:** Cloud Storage rules and 30-day lifecycle are configured.
    -   **âœ… Cloud Functions (Core):** `sendFollowerPush` and `fanOutBroadcast` are implemented with v2 syntax, unit-tested, and verified on the local emulator.
    -   **âœ… Local Emulator Environment:** Full Firebase Emulator Suite is configured and the local testing workflow is documented.

## What's Left to Build

-   **Phase 2 - Data Layer (Remaining):**
    -   Scaffold AI helper Cloud Functions (`generateCaption`, `getRecipeSnippet`, `vectorSearchFAQ`).

-   **Phase 3 - Interface Layer:**
    -   **âœ… Authentication Flow:** Phone/email OTP authentication with Firebase Auth is complete.
    -   Profile, Media Capture, and Feed UI screens still needed.

-   **Phase 4 - Implementation Layer:**
    -   All business logic connecting the UI to the backend, including the offline media queue and AI helper features.

## Known Issues & Blockers

-   **iOS Background Sync:** Testing requires manual verification via console logs due to platform limitations. This is expected behavior, not a bug.
-   **Tooling Issue:** The agent has a persistent issue editing the `README.md` file, which requires manual attention if further updates are needed.
