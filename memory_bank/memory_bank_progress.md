    -   **âœ… Cloud Functions (Core):** `sendFollowerPush` and `fanOutBroadcast` are implemented with v2 syntax, unit-tested, and verified on the local emulator.
    -   **âœ… Cloud Functions (AI Prep):** AI helper functions scaffolded and ready for Phase 4 implementation.
    -   **âœ… Local Emulator Environment:** Full Firebase Emulator Suite is configured and the local testing workflow is documented.

-   **Phase 3 - Interface Layer:** ðŸ”„ **IN PROGRESS - Phase 3.1 Complete**
    -   **âœ… Design System Implementation:** Complete MarketSnap design system implemented based on `snap_design.md` with farmers-market aesthetic.
    -   **âœ… Theme System:** Comprehensive theme system with light/dark mode support, proper color palette, typography, and spacing.
    -   **âœ… Component Library:** MarketSnap-branded component library with buttons, inputs, cards, status messages, and loading indicators.

    -   **âœ… Authentication Flow:** Phone/email OTP authentication with Firebase Auth is complete with cross-platform support and emulator integration.
    -   **âœ… Login Screen Redesign:** AuthWelcomeScreen redesigned to match `login_page.png` reference with basket character icon and farmers-market branding.
    -   **âœ… Auth Screen Enhancement:** All authentication screens (email, phone, OTP) updated with new design system while maintaining functionality.
    -   **âœ… Camera Preview & Photo Capture:** Full camera interface with photo capture, flash controls, camera switching, and modern UI.
    -   **âœ… 5-Second Video Recording:** Complete video recording with auto-stop, live countdown, cross-platform support, and emulator optimizations.

## What's Left to Build

-   **Phase 3 - Interface Layer (Remaining):**
    -   Profile form with stall name, market city, and avatar upload (apply new design system).
    -   Review screen with LUT filter application and "Post" button (apply new design system).
    -   Story reel & feed UI components (apply new design system).
    -   Settings & help screens (apply new design system).
    -   Apply design system cohesively to camera capture screens.

## Known Issues & Blockers

-   **iOS Background Sync:** Testing requires manual verification via console logs due to platform limitations. This is expected behavior, not a bug.
-   **Android Emulator Buffer Warnings:** Optimized with reduced resolution settings for emulators while maintaining high quality for real devices.
