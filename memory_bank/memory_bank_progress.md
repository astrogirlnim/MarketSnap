## What Works

-   **Phase 1 - Foundation:** âœ… **COMPLETE**
    -   Flutter project created and all core dependencies are installed.
    -   Firebase SDKs are configured for both Android and iOS.
    -   Local data stores (Hive) and background job framework (WorkManager) are in place.
    -   Background sync fully functional on both platforms (iOS requires console log verification).

-   **Phase 2 - Data Layer:** ðŸ”„ **IN PROGRESS - Phase 2.2 Complete**
    -   **âœ… Firestore Schema & Security:** Database schema (`vendors`, `snaps`, `broadcasts`, `followers`) is defined with proper indexes. Security rules implemented and tested with local emulator. Unauthenticated writes are successfully blocked.
    -   **âœ… Storage Security:** Cloud Storage security rules implemented, restricting uploads to authenticated users and enforcing 1MB file size limit.
    -   **âœ… Storage TTL:** 30-day lifecycle rule configured for automatic media deletion.
    -   **âœ… Cloud Functions Setup:** TypeScript project initialized with ESLint, compiles successfully.
    -   **âœ… Local Emulator Environment:** Full Firebase Emulator Suite (Auth, Firestore, Functions, Storage) configured and running.
    -   **âœ… Firebase Configuration:** Environment-based configuration implemented with proper security practices.
    -   **âœ… Development Environment:** Firebase options file generated and integrated successfully.

## What's Left to Build

-   **Phase 2 - Data Layer (Remaining):**
    -   Develop the core Cloud Functions (`sendFollowerPush`, `fanOutBroadcast`).
    -   Scaffold AI helper Cloud Functions (`generateCaption`, `getRecipeSnippet`, `vectorSearchFAQ`).

-   **Phase 3 - Interface Layer:**
    -   All UI screens and user flows, including Auth, Profile, Media Capture, and Feeds.

-   **Phase 4 - Implementation Layer:**
    -   All business logic connecting the UI to the backend, including the offline media queue and AI helper features.

## Known Issues & Blockers

-   **âœ… RESOLVED: Firebase Configuration Missing:** Firebase options file has been generated and properly integrated.
-   **âœ… RESOLVED: HiveService Initialization:** Fixed parameter mismatch in main.dart initialization.
-   **iOS Background Sync:** Testing requires manual verification via console logs due to platform limitations.
