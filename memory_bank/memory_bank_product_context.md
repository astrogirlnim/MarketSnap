# Product Context – "Why"

## Problem Statement
Rural vendors rely on social feeds that demand strong data signals and time‑consuming copywriting. Patchy connectivity causes missed posts, stale inventory, and lost sales.

## Target Users
- **Primary:** Farmers‑market vendors (“Lena”) running stalls with limited marketing time and unreliable 3G.
- **Secondary:** Shoppers (“Sam”) seeking fresh local produce without heavy data use.

## User Experience Goals
1. **Reliability:** Capture once, trust the queue—no lost media.
2. **Urgency:** Ephemeral stories + push create FOMO to drive foot traffic.
3. **Low Bandwidth:** Photos ≤ 200 kB; clips ≤ 1 MB.
4. **Zero‑Friction:** One‑tap post; optional AI caption later.
5. **Privacy Respectful:** Vendor‑only coarse location; no shopper GPS.
