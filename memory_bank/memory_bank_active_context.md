## Recent Changes (January 2025)

### **✅ Critical Database Corruption Bug Fix (January 25, 2025):**

**The Issue - App Crash on Startup:**
- **Symptoms:** Red error screen preventing app launch
- **Primary Error:** `HiveError: Cannot read, unknown typeId: 35. Did you forget to register an adapter?`
- **Secondary Error:** `LateInitializationError: Field 'vendorProfileBox' has not been initialized`
- **Impact:** Complete app failure - no functionality accessible

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- **TypeId Conflict:** Both `VendorProfile` and `PendingMediaItem` declared typeId: 1
- **Registration Logic Bug:** HiveService checked typeId 1 twice instead of checking typeId 3 for PendingMediaItem
- **Database Corruption:** Conflict created corrupted data with unknown typeId 35

**Comprehensive Solution Implemented:**
1. **Fixed TypeId Assignments:**
   ```dart
   @HiveType(typeId: 0) class UserSettings      // ✅ Correct
   @HiveType(typeId: 1) class VendorProfile     // ✅ Correct  
   @HiveType(typeId: 2) enum MediaType          // ✅ Correct
   @HiveType(typeId: 3) class PendingMediaItem  // ✅ Fixed: Changed from 1 to 3
   ```

2. **Fixed HiveService Registration Logic:**
   ```dart
   // Before (BUG):
   if (!Hive.isAdapterRegistered(1)) { // VendorProfile
   if (!Hive.isAdapterRegistered(1)) { // PendingMediaItem - WRONG!
   
   // After (FIXED):
   if (!Hive.isAdapterRegistered(1)) { // VendorProfile
   if (!Hive.isAdapterRegistered(3)) { // PendingMediaItem - CORRECT!
   ```

3. **Added Database Error Recovery:**
   - Created `_openBoxWithRecovery()` method to handle corrupted databases
   - Automatically deletes corrupted boxes and creates fresh ones
   - Graceful degradation with comprehensive logging

4. **Full Validation Process:**
   - ✅ `flutter analyze` - No issues found
   - ✅ `dart format` - Code formatting applied (2 files)
   - ✅ `dart fix --apply` - No additional fixes needed
   - ✅ `flutter build apk --debug` - Successful build
   - ✅ `flutter test` - All 11 tests passing
   - ✅ Runtime verification - App launches successfully

**Result:** App now launches successfully with all database operations working correctly. This was a critical production-blocking bug that has been completely resolved.

### **✅ iOS Google Auth Implementation & UI Fixes:**

**iOS Google Auth Issue Resolution:**
- **Problem:** Google Auth only working on Android, iOS users couldn't see Google Sign-In option
- **Root Cause:** Missing CFBundleURLTypes configuration in iOS Info.plist
- **Solution:** Added URL scheme configuration with proper REVERSED_CLIENT_ID
- **UI Fix:** Removed iOS-specific bypass that was hiding authentication method dialog
- **Result:** Full cross-platform Google Auth support with identical UX on both platforms

**UI Overflow Error Resolution:**
- **Problem:** RenderFlex overflow error in MediaReviewScreen SnackBar
- **Root Cause:** Success message text not wrapped in Expanded widget
- **Solution:** Added Expanded wrapper to prevent text overflow
- **Validation:** Applied comprehensive analysis pipeline (analyze, format, fix, build, test)
- **Result:** Clean UI rendering with no overflow errors

### **✅ Previous Critical Authentication Fixes:**

**OTP Verification Issue Resolution:**
- **Problem:** "Invalid verification code" errors when using correct codes from Firebase emulator
- **Root Cause:** Verification ID not updating when OTP codes were resent
- **Solution:** Added mutable `_currentVerificationId` to track active verification sessions
- **Result:** OTP verification now works reliably with resend functionality

**Account Linking System Implementation:**
- **Problem:** Different auth methods (Google vs Phone) created separate vendor profiles
- **Root Cause:** Each auth method generates different Firebase Auth UIDs
- **Solution:** Created AccountLinkingService to link accounts based on shared contact info
- **Result:** Prevents duplicate vendor profiles per user

**Sign-Out Spinner Fix:**
- **Problem:** Sign-out button spinning indefinitely
- **Root Cause:** Firebase Auth emulator connection timeouts without proper error handling
- **Solution:** Added 10-second timeout with enhanced error handling
- **Result:** Sign-out operations complete successfully

### **✅ CI/CD Pipeline Optimization (January 25, 2025):**

**Parallel Execution Implementation:**
- **Problem:** Sequential CI/CD pipeline was taking 18-25 minutes with backend deployment blocking APK building
- **Solution:** Split single `deploy_android` job into two parallel jobs: `build_android` and `deploy_backend`
- **Architecture Change:** Both jobs now run concurrently after `validate` job completes
- **Performance Improvement:** ~30-40% reduction in total pipeline time (now 13-20 minutes)

**Technical Implementation:**
1. **`build_android` Job:**
   - Handles Android APK building and Firebase App Distribution
   - Dependencies: Flutter, Java 17, Firebase CLI, release keystore setup
   - Output: Signed APK deployed to Firebase App Distribution for testers

2. **`deploy_backend` Job:**
   - Handles Firebase backend services deployment
   - Dependencies: Node.js, Firebase CLI, gcloud CLI
   - Tasks: Cloud Functions build/deploy, Firestore/Storage rules, TTL policies

**Key Benefits:**
- **Parallel Execution:** No interdependencies between APK building and backend deployment
- **Resource Efficiency:** Better utilization of GitHub Actions runners
- **Faster Feedback:** Developers get build results faster
- **Stateless Operations:** No race conditions due to independent Firebase CLI operations

## Current Work Focus

**Phase 3.3: Story Reel & Feed Implementation + Image Loading Issue Resolution**

We have successfully completed Phase 3.3 - Story Reel & Feed implementation and resolved a critical image loading issue that was preventing proper testing of the feed functionality.

### **✅ Phase 3.3: Story Reel & Feed Implementation - COMPLETED (January 27, 2025)**

1. **Story Reel & Feed UI Components** ✅ **COMPLETED**
   - ✅ Created `MainShellScreen` with bottom navigation (Feed, Capture, Profile tabs)
   - ✅ Built comprehensive data models: `Snap` and `StoryItem` with proper Firestore integration
   - ✅ Implemented `FeedService` for data fetching from Firestore with real-time updates
   - ✅ Created UI components: `StoryCarouselWidget` (horizontal story list) and `FeedPostWidget` (feed cards)
   - ✅ Updated `FeedScreen` with pull-to-refresh, story carousel, and scrollable feed
   - ✅ Added `cached_network_image` dependency for image caching and performance
   - ✅ Modified `main.dart` to navigate to `MainShellScreen` instead of direct camera access
   - ✅ Applied MarketSnap design system consistently throughout feed components

2. **Navigation Flow Integration** ✅ **COMPLETED**
   - ✅ Fixed `AuthWrapper` compilation error by converting to `StatefulWidget`

   - ✅ Created Node.js script (`add_test_data_admin.js`) using Firebase Admin SDK to bypass security rules
   - ✅ **CRITICAL FIX:** Resolved image loading network timeout issue by replacing external `via.placeholder.com` URLs with local data URL images
   - ✅ Added comprehensive test data with 4 sample snaps from 2 different vendors
   - ✅ Enhanced scripts with data cleanup and detailed logging for debugging

### **✅ Critical Image Loading Issue Resolution (January 27, 2025)**

**Problem:** Story Reel & Feed showing snap cards with vendor names and captions, but images stuck in perpetual loading state with network timeout errors.

**Root Cause:** Test data script was using external `via.placeholder.com` URLs which were timing out in the emulator environment, causing `SocketException: Operation timed out` errors.

**Solution Implemented:**
- **Replaced External URLs:** Switched from `via.placeholder.com` to local data URL images (base64-encoded 1x1 pixel PNGs)
- **Enhanced Test Script:** Added `PLACEHOLDER_IMAGES` constants with colored data URLs for different content types
- **Local Network Independence:** Images now load instantly without external network requests
- **Data Cleanup:** Script now clears existing test data before adding new data for consistent testing

**Result:** Feed now displays images instantly, enabling proper testing of Story Reel & Feed functionality.
