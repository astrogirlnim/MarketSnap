# Active Context (Now)

- **Background sync (WorkManager) is now fully functional on both Android and iOS.**
  - Android: Execution is tracked and can be verified in-app.
  - iOS: Execution must be verified via console logs due to platform limitations (SharedPreferences not available in background isolate).
- All test UI and debug buttons have been removed; the implementation is now production-ready.
- Documentation and checklist updated to reflect the final state and manual verification approach for iOS.
