## Current Focus

We have successfully completed **Phase 2.2: Storage Buckets & Configuration** and are now ready to begin **Phase 2.3: Cloud Functions (Core)**.

### ✅ Phase 2.2 Complete - Recent Achievements:

-   **Firebase Configuration Security:** Implemented environment-based configuration using `.env` file and `flutter_dotenv`, eliminating hardcoded API keys from source code.
-   **Firebase Options Integration:** Generated and integrated `lib/firebase_options.dart` using FlutterFire CLI for proper cross-platform Firebase initialization.
-   **HiveService Fix:** Resolved initialization parameter mismatch in `main.dart` to properly align with service implementation.
-   **Development Environment Stability:** Restored emulator script compatibility and verified cross-platform builds (Android & iOS).
-   **Build Verification:** Successfully tested both Android APK and iOS app builds to ensure no regressions.

## Recent Changes

-   **Security Hardening:** All Firebase configuration now uses environment variables with no sensitive data in version control.
-   **Firebase Options Generated:** Used `flutterfire configure` to create proper platform-specific Firebase configuration.
-   **Build System Validation:** Confirmed that both Android and iOS builds compile successfully with new configuration.
-   **Development Workflow:** Restored full development emulator functionality with proper Firebase backend integration.

## Next Steps

1.  **Begin Phase 2.3 (Cloud Functions - Core):**
    -   Implement `sendFollowerPush` function for FCM notifications when snaps are created
    -   Implement `fanOutBroadcast` function for FCM notifications when broadcasts are created
    -   Add unit tests using Firebase Functions Test SDK
2.  **Prepare for Phase 2.4 (Cloud Functions - AI Prep):**
    -   Scaffold AI helper functions with dummy returns
    -   Set up environment variables for OpenAI integration

## Blockers Resolved

- ✅ **Firebase Configuration Missing:** `lib/firebase_options.dart` has been generated and integrated
- ✅ **HiveService Initialization Error:** Parameter mismatch in `main.dart` has been fixed
- ✅ **Android Build Failures:** All compilation errors resolved, builds working correctly

## Current Sprint: Phase 2.3 – Cloud Functions (Core) (Week of June 24, 2025)

### Ready to Start
1. Implement `sendFollowerPush` Cloud Function
2. Implement `fanOutBroadcast` Cloud Function  
3. Add comprehensive unit tests for both functions
4. Test functions with local Firebase Emulator Suite

### Recently Completed ✅
- Phase 2.2: Storage Buckets & Configuration
- Firebase security configuration with environment variables
- Development environment stability improvements
- Cross-platform build verification

### Blockers
_All previous blockers resolved._

# Active Context (Now)

- **Background sync (WorkManager) is now fully functional on both Android and iOS.**
  - Android: Execution is tracked and can be verified in-app.
  - iOS: Execution must be verified via console logs due to platform limitations (SharedPreferences not available in background isolate).
- All test UI and debug buttons have been removed; the implementation is now production-ready.
- Documentation and checklist updated to reflect the final state and manual verification approach for iOS.

**Current Sprint:** Phase 1 – Foundation (Week of June 24 2025)

### In Progress
- Flutter project bootstrap.
- Firebase project creation & SDK integration.
- Hive box scaffolding.

### Next Up
1. Register `SyncPendingMediaTask` WorkManager job.
2. Add unit tests for queue persistence.
3. Import LUT assets & set CI size gate.

### Recently Completed
- PRD v1.1 approved.
- MVP checklist generated and reformatted to nested checkboxes.

### Blockers
_None identified._
