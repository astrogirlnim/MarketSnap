## 🚨 **CRITICAL PRIORITY: Authentication Re-Login Flow Debugging**

**Current Status:** 🔴 **HIGH PRIORITY DEBUGGING** - Persistent authentication redirect bug after AccountLinkingService fix

**Issue:** Both vendor and regular users can authenticate successfully and reach main app, but immediately get redirected back to login screen despite successful authentication flow completion.

**Latest Investigation Results (January 27, 2025 - 17:23 UTC):**

**✅ AccountLinkingService Fix Successfully Implemented:**
- Updated `findExistingProfileForCurrentUser()` to search both `vendors` and `regularUsers` collections
- Both user types now properly detected and linked during authentication
- All logs show successful profile detection and linking

**❌ Navigation Layer Issue Identified:**
Despite successful authentication and profile linking, users still redirected to login. Log analysis shows:

**Vendor User (Ld6zM8dFEfBycWaN6fiLAyQq2KYy):**
```
[AccountLinkingService] Successfully linked existing profile: Test
[AuthWrapper] User has existing profile - going to main app
[MainShellScreen] User type detected: Vendor
```

**Regular User (JjWeYyrbtlh1OUHc7RxmnqQtVENE):**
```
[AccountLinkingService] Successfully linked existing profile: Customer  
[AuthWrapper] User has existing profile - going to main app
[MainShellScreen] User type detected: Regular User
```

**Critical Finding:** All backend logic working correctly, but users still experience redirect to login screen.

**Hypothesis - Navigation Layer Issues:**
1. **Widget Rebuild Cycles:** AuthWrapper may be re-evaluating auth state causing navigation loops
2. **Stream/Future Timing:** Race conditions in FutureBuilder/StreamBuilder logic
3. **Route Replacement:** Navigation state management issues in main.dart AuthWrapper
4. **Memory Leaks:** Widget disposal and recreation causing state loss

**Next Investigation Priority:**
- Examine AuthWrapper FutureBuilder/StreamBuilder implementation 
- Check widget lifecycle and navigation state management
- Look for race conditions in authentication state evaluation
- Verify route replacement logic in AuthWrapper

**Impact Assessment:**
- **Authentication Backend:** ✅ Working perfectly (Firebase, profiles, linking)
- **Profile Detection:** ✅ Both user types detected correctly
- **User Experience:** ❌ **CRITICAL** - Users cannot stay authenticated despite successful login
- **Code Quality:** ✅ flutter analyze (0 issues), all tests passing

**Priority Level:** 🚨 **HIGHEST PRIORITY** - Critical authentication flow broken despite working backend

## 🚨 **CURRENT CRITICAL ISSUE: Messaging Authentication Error**

**Current Status:** 🔄 **ACTIVE INVESTIGATION** - Permission denied error when starting new conversations

**Problem:** Users experience `[cloud_firestore/permission-denied]` error when trying to start a new conversation with a vendor, despite being properly authenticated.

**Context:**
- User is authenticated and has completed profile
- Vendor discovery works correctly (shows 4 test vendors)
- Error occurs when tapping on a vendor to start chat
- Should be able to start new conversations with any vendor

**Error Details:**
```
Error: [cloud_firestore/permission-denied] The caller does not have permission to execute the specified operation.
```

**Analysis Completed:**
1. ✅ Firestore rules are correct - allow authenticated users to read messages they're involved in
2. ✅ Firebase emulators running properly (Auth: 9099, Firestore: 8080)
3. ✅ User authentication verified - profile exists and user is signed in
4. ✅ Vendor data exists - 5 vendors including 4 test vendors
5. ❌ Test message creation failing - 0 messages in database despite script success
6. 🔄 Root cause: Empty conversation query authentication context issue

**Hypothesis:**
The issue occurs when `MessagingService.getConversationMessages()` queries for messages in a conversation that doesn't exist yet (new conversation). Even though the Firestore rules are correct, the query execution itself may have authentication context issues when no documents match.

**Implementation Status:**
- ✅ Chat screen with comprehensive error handling and authentication checks
- ✅ Vendor discovery with proper filtering and logging
- ✅ Message model with all required fields (conversationId, expiresAt, etc.)
- ❌ New conversation flow failing due to authentication context
- 🔄 Test data script issues preventing proper testing

- **Hive Integration**: Added authCache box for persistent storage
- **CachedUser Model**: Simple model for offline authentication state
- **30-Day Expiry**: Automatic cache invalidation for security
- **Cross-restart Persistence**: Users remain logged in after app restart

### 🎯 Expected Offline Authentication Behavior (DOCUMENTED)

#### When User is Online and Authenticates
1. User completes phone/email verification successfully
2. Firebase Auth creates authenticated user session
3. AuthService caches user data in Hive (uid, email, phone, displayName, photoURL)
4. User can access all app features normally

#### When User Goes Offline (After Initial Authentication)
1. **Immediate Offline Access**: User remains authenticated using cached data
2. **Profile Access**: Local vendor profile data available from Hive
3. **Media Posting**: Photos/videos queue locally for upload when online
4. **Navigation**: Full app navigation remains functional
5. **Data Persistence**: Authentication state survives app restarts

#### When User Starts App Offline (Previously Authenticated)
1. **Cached Authentication**: AuthService loads cached user from Hive
2. **Validity Check**: Ensures cached data is < 30 days old
3. **Offline Mode**: App functions fully with local data
4. **Queue Processing**: Pending uploads remain queued until connectivity returns
5. **Profile Management**: Local profile editing continues to work

#### When User Tries to Authenticate While Offline
1. **Prevention**: Phone/email verification requires network connection
2. **Clear Messaging**: "Cannot verify while offline" error message
3. **Offline Indicator**: Visual indicator shows offline status
4. **Guidance**: User instructed to connect to internet for initial authentication

#### Security & Data Management
1. **30-Day Expiry**: Cached authentication expires after 30 days
2. **Sign Out**: Clears both Firebase session and local cache
3. **Data Sync**: Profile changes sync when connectivity returns
4. **Privacy**: No sensitive tokens stored locally, only basic user metadata

### 🔧 Technical Implementation Status

# MarketSnap Active Context

## Current Priority: Messages Loading Bug Investigation (Phase 4.7)
**Status**: INVESTIGATION COMPLETE - AWAITING NEXT DEBUGGING SESSION
**Date**: 2025-06-27
**Priority**: HIGH

### Issue Summary
Messages screen remains in perpetual loading state despite comprehensive fixes. Root cause identified as **authentication state management issue** rather than Firestore query problems.

### Investigation Results
- ✅ **Firestore Queries**: Working correctly (verified with direct testing)
- ✅ **Database Indexes**: Composite indexes properly configured
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive timeout and retry mechanisms implemented
- ❌ **Auth State Stream**: `FirebaseAuth.instance.authStateChanges()` hanging in Messages screen context
- ❌ **Project Configuration**: Emulators running with wrong project ID

### Completed Implementation
1. **Enhanced ConversationListScreen** with timeout protection and error handling
2. **MessagingService improvements** with stream timeout and recovery
3. **Firestore composite indexes** for messages collection
4. **VendorProfile constructor fixes** 
5. **Comprehensive debugging logs** throughout the messaging flow

### Key Technical Finding
The issue is **NOT** in the Firestore queries or messaging service logic. The `StreamBuilder<User?>` on `FirebaseAuth.instance.authStateChanges()` never resolves to an authenticated state specifically in the Messages screen, despite working correctly in other parts of the app.

### Next Debugging Session Priorities
1. **Auth State Investigation**: Deep dive into why auth stream hangs in Messages screen
2. **State Management**: Consider implementing BLoC/Riverpod for Messages feature
3. **Project Configuration**: Fix emulator project ID consistency
4. **Navigation Context**: Investigate if navigation affects auth stream resolution

## Phase 4.11 - Critical Auth Bug & Resolution (June 27, 2025)

**Context:** The application was plagued by a critical authentication bug where users, after signing out, could not sign back in. They would be redirected to the login screen despite successful authentication.

**Resolution Summary:**
The root cause was the premature disposal of the singleton `AuthService`. The `AuthWrapper` widget's `dispose` method was incorrectly destroying the service, which is designed to persist for the entire application lifecycle. Once a user signed out, the service was disposed, rendering subsequent login attempts futile as the authentication stream was closed.

**Fix:**
- **File:** `lib/main.dart`
- **Action:** The `dispose` method within `_AuthWrapperState` was removed. This ensures the `AuthService` singleton persists across login/logout cycles, resolving the redirect loop permanently.
- **Verification:** The fix was confirmed by extensive testing of sign-out and sign-in flows with different user types.

**Current Status:** The authentication system is now stable and robust. The application is ready for further development on the implementation layer.

### **✅ Phase 4.13 Snap/Story Deletion COMPLETED (January 29, 2025)**
