## üö® **CRITICAL PRIORITY: Authentication Re-Login Flow Debugging**

**Current Status:** üî¥ **HIGH PRIORITY DEBUGGING** - Persistent authentication redirect bug after AccountLinkingService fix

**Issue:** Both vendor and regular users can authenticate successfully and reach main app, but immediately get redirected back to login screen despite successful authentication flow completion.

**Latest Investigation Results (January 27, 2025 - 17:23 UTC):**

**‚úÖ AccountLinkingService Fix Successfully Implemented:**
- Updated `findExistingProfileForCurrentUser()` to search both `vendors` and `regularUsers` collections
- Both user types now properly detected and linked during authentication
- All logs show successful profile detection and linking

**‚ùå Navigation Layer Issue Identified:**
Despite successful authentication and profile linking, users still redirected to login. Log analysis shows:

**Vendor User (Ld6zM8dFEfBycWaN6fiLAyQq2KYy):**
```
[AccountLinkingService] Successfully linked existing profile: Test
[AuthWrapper] User has existing profile - going to main app
[MainShellScreen] User type detected: Vendor
```

**Regular User (JjWeYyrbtlh1OUHc7RxmnqQtVENE):**
```
[AccountLinkingService] Successfully linked existing profile: Customer  
[AuthWrapper] User has existing profile - going to main app
[MainShellScreen] User type detected: Regular User
```

**Critical Finding:** All backend logic working correctly, but users still experience redirect to login screen.

**Hypothesis - Navigation Layer Issues:**
1. **Widget Rebuild Cycles:** AuthWrapper may be re-evaluating auth state causing navigation loops
2. **Stream/Future Timing:** Race conditions in FutureBuilder/StreamBuilder logic
3. **Route Replacement:** Navigation state management issues in main.dart AuthWrapper
4. **Memory Leaks:** Widget disposal and recreation causing state loss

**Next Investigation Priority:**
- Examine AuthWrapper FutureBuilder/StreamBuilder implementation 
- Check widget lifecycle and navigation state management
- Look for race conditions in authentication state evaluation
- Verify route replacement logic in AuthWrapper

**Impact Assessment:**
- **Authentication Backend:** ‚úÖ Working perfectly (Firebase, profiles, linking)
- **Profile Detection:** ‚úÖ Both user types detected correctly
- **User Experience:** ‚ùå **CRITICAL** - Users cannot stay authenticated despite successful login
- **Code Quality:** ‚úÖ flutter analyze (0 issues), all tests passing

**Priority Level:** üö® **HIGHEST PRIORITY** - Critical authentication flow broken despite working backend

## üö® **CRITICAL BUG: Media Posting Failure**

**Current Status:** ‚úÖ **AUTHENTICATION ISSUES RESOLVED** - Fixed critical authentication errors that were blocking media posting

**Problem:** Users could authenticate, capture media, and receive "Media posted successfully!" confirmation, but posts did not appear in the feed. Analysis showed **0 items actually uploaded** to Firebase Storage due to authentication token issues.

**Root Causes Identified & Fixed:**
1. ‚úÖ **Invalid Refresh Token Handling:** `INVALID_REFRESH_TOKEN` errors now properly sign out users and force re-authentication
2. ‚úÖ **Firebase App Check Security:** Removed insecure debug provider fallback in production builds
3. ‚úÖ **Authentication Error Handling:** Added comprehensive error handling for critical auth failures
4. üîÑ **File Path Issues:** Media files deleted/moved before upload completion (needs further investigation)
5. üîÑ **Silent Upload Failures:** BackgroundSyncService reports "Uploaded 0 items" but user sees success message (needs investigation)

**Authentication Fixes Implemented (January 27, 2025):**
- ‚úÖ Enhanced `AuthService` with `handleFirebaseAuthException()` method that signs out users on critical errors
- ‚úÖ Added `_signInWithCredentialWrapper()` for consistent error handling across all sign-in methods
- ‚úÖ Fixed App Check configuration to prevent "Too many attempts" errors in production
- ‚úÖ Added comprehensive error messages for different authentication failure scenarios
- ‚úÖ Removed insecure debug provider fallback that could compromise production security

**Technical Details:**
- Fixed `await_only_futures` issue in `background_sync_service.dart` (line 232)
- Removed unused methods: `_processPendingUploads()` and `_getPendingDirectory()`
- Cleaned up all import issues and code formatting
- Added SHA-1 fingerprint documentation for Firebase App Check setup

**Next Steps:**
1. üîÑ Investigate remaining file persistence issues during upload

## üö® **CURRENT CRITICAL ISSUE: Messaging Authentication Error**

**Current Status:** üîÑ **ACTIVE INVESTIGATION** - Permission denied error when starting new conversations

**Problem:** Users experience `[cloud_firestore/permission-denied]` error when trying to start a new conversation with a vendor, despite being properly authenticated.

**Context:**
- User is authenticated and has completed profile
- Vendor discovery works correctly (shows 4 test vendors)
- Error occurs when tapping on a vendor to start chat
- Should be able to start new conversations with any vendor

**Error Details:**
```
Error: [cloud_firestore/permission-denied] The caller does not have permission to execute the specified operation.
```

**Analysis Completed:**
1. ‚úÖ Firestore rules are correct - allow authenticated users to read messages they're involved in
2. ‚úÖ Firebase emulators running properly (Auth: 9099, Firestore: 8080)
3. ‚úÖ User authentication verified - profile exists and user is signed in
4. ‚úÖ Vendor data exists - 5 vendors including 4 test vendors
5. ‚ùå Test message creation failing - 0 messages in database despite script success
6. üîÑ Root cause: Empty conversation query authentication context issue

**Hypothesis:**
The issue occurs when `MessagingService.getConversationMessages()` queries for messages in a conversation that doesn't exist yet (new conversation). Even though the Firestore rules are correct, the query execution itself may have authentication context issues when no documents match.

**Implementation Status:**
- ‚úÖ Chat screen with comprehensive error handling and authentication checks
- ‚úÖ Vendor discovery with proper filtering and logging
- ‚úÖ Message model with all required fields (conversationId, expiresAt, etc.)
- ‚ùå New conversation flow failing due to authentication context
- üîÑ Test data script issues preventing proper testing

**Next Actions:**
1. Investigate empty conversation query authentication context
2. Add detailed logging to identify exact failure point
3. Test simplified query structure for new conversations
4. Verify conversation ID generation logic
5. Create manual test for new conversation flow

**Files Involved:**
- `lib/features/messaging/presentation/screens/chat_screen.dart`
- `lib/core/services/messaging_service.dart`
- `firestore.rules`
- `scripts/setup_messaging_test_data.js`

   - ‚úÖ Cache authenticated user data across app restarts (30-day expiry)
   - ‚úÖ Updated initialization order: HiveService before AuthService
   - ‚úÖ Clear authentication cache on sign out
   - ‚ùå **BLOCKED**: Firebase Auth interface compatibility issue with _CachedFirebaseUser
   - ‚ùå Missing method implementations causing compilation failure

### üö® Current Blockers

#### Firebase Auth Interface Compatibility Issue
**Problem**: `_CachedFirebaseUser` class missing required method implementations
**Error**: 
```
The non-abstract class '_CachedFirebaseUser' is missing implementations for these members:
- User.linkWithProvider
- User.reauthenticateWithProvider
```

**Status**: Attempted fix by adding missing methods, but compilation still fails
**Next Steps**: 
1. Investigate Firebase Auth version compatibility
2. Consider alternative approach using wrapper pattern instead of implementing User interface
3. Explore using Firebase Auth's built-in persistence mechanisms

### üìù Recent Changes (Last 24 Hours)

#### Enhanced Offline UX Implementation
- **connectivity_plus**: Added real-time network monitoring
- **Smart Posting Flow**: 10-second timeout online, instant queue offline  
- **Better Messaging**: "Will post when online" for offline state
- **Color-coded Feedback**: Context-aware UI states
- **Navigation Freedom**: Users can navigate away during posting

#### Offline Authentication Persistence (Attempted)
- **Hive Integration**: Added authCache box for persistent storage
- **CachedUser Model**: Simple model for offline authentication state
- **30-Day Expiry**: Automatic cache invalidation for security
- **Cross-restart Persistence**: Users remain logged in after app restart

### üéØ Expected Offline Authentication Behavior (DOCUMENTED)

#### When User is Online and Authenticates
1. User completes phone/email verification successfully
2. Firebase Auth creates authenticated user session
3. AuthService caches user data in Hive (uid, email, phone, displayName, photoURL)
4. User can access all app features normally

#### When User Goes Offline (After Initial Authentication)
1. **Immediate Offline Access**: User remains authenticated using cached data
2. **Profile Access**: Local vendor profile data available from Hive
3. **Media Posting**: Photos/videos queue locally for upload when online
4. **Navigation**: Full app navigation remains functional
5. **Data Persistence**: Authentication state survives app restarts

#### When User Starts App Offline (Previously Authenticated)
1. **Cached Authentication**: AuthService loads cached user from Hive
2. **Validity Check**: Ensures cached data is < 30 days old
3. **Offline Mode**: App functions fully with local data
4. **Queue Processing**: Pending uploads remain queued until connectivity returns
5. **Profile Management**: Local profile editing continues to work

#### When User Tries to Authenticate While Offline
1. **Prevention**: Phone/email verification requires network connection
2. **Clear Messaging**: "Cannot verify while offline" error message
3. **Offline Indicator**: Visual indicator shows offline status
4. **Guidance**: User instructed to connect to internet for initial authentication

#### Security & Data Management
1. **30-Day Expiry**: Cached authentication expires after 30 days
2. **Sign Out**: Clears both Firebase session and local cache
3. **Data Sync**: Profile changes sync when connectivity returns
4. **Privacy**: No sensitive tokens stored locally, only basic user metadata

### üîß Technical Implementation Status

#### Working Components
- ‚úÖ HiveService with authCache box
- ‚úÖ AuthService offline state management
- ‚úÖ Connectivity monitoring
- ‚úÖ Cache expiry logic
- ‚úÖ Sign out cache clearing

#### Blocked Components

The issue is **NOT** in the Firestore queries or messaging service logic. The `StreamBuilder<User?>` on `FirebaseAuth.instance.authStateChanges()` never resolves to an authenticated state specifically in the Messages screen, despite working correctly in other parts of the app.

### Next Debugging Session Priorities
1. **Auth State Investigation**: Deep dive into why auth stream hangs in Messages screen
2. **State Management**: Consider implementing BLoC/Riverpod for Messages feature
3. **Project Configuration**: Fix emulator project ID consistency
4. **Navigation Context**: Investigate if navigation affects auth stream resolution

## Phase 4.11 - Critical Auth Bug & Resolution (June 27, 2025)

**Context:** The application was plagued by a critical authentication bug where users, after signing out, could not sign back in. They would be redirected to the login screen despite successful authentication.

**Resolution Summary:**
The root cause was the premature disposal of the singleton `AuthService`. The `AuthWrapper` widget's `dispose` method was incorrectly destroying the service, which is designed to persist for the entire application lifecycle. Once a user signed out, the service was disposed, rendering subsequent login attempts futile as the authentication stream was closed.

**Fix:**
- **File:** `lib/main.dart`
- **Action:** The `dispose` method within `_AuthWrapperState` was removed. This ensures the `AuthService` singleton persists across login/logout cycles, resolving the redirect loop permanently.
- **Verification:** The fix was confirmed by extensive testing of sign-out and sign-in flows with different user types.

**Current Status:** The authentication system is now stable and robust. The application is ready for further development on the implementation layer.
