## Current Work Focus

**Phase 3.1: Auth & Profile Screens**

We're implementing the user interface layer for authentication and vendor profile management.

1. **Phone/Email OTP Authentication Flow** âœ… **COMPLETED**
   - âœ… Firebase Auth integration with OTP verification implemented
   - âœ… Authentication screens created (AuthWelcomeScreen, PhoneAuthScreen, EmailAuthScreen, OTPVerificationScreen)
   - âœ… Cross-platform support for iOS and Android with platform-specific handling
   - âœ… Firebase emulator integration working for local development
   - âœ… Network security configuration for Android cleartext HTTP to emulators
   - âœ… iOS-specific crash prevention and fallback mechanisms

2. **Profile Form Implementation** ðŸ“‹ **NEXT**
   - Vendor profile creation/editing (stall name, market city, avatar upload)
   - Offline caching validation in Hive

## Recent Changes

- **âœ… Authentication Implementation Complete:** Full authentication flow implemented with AuthService, all auth screens, and comprehensive error handling
- **âœ… Cross-Platform Bug Fixes:** Resolved Android cleartext HTTP issue with network security config and iOS Firebase Auth crashes with platform-specific handling
- **âœ… Firebase Emulator Integration:** Working seamlessly with both Android and iOS platforms

## Current Status

**Authentication is fully functional:**
- âœ… Android: Phone and email authentication working with Firebase emulators
- âœ… iOS: Email authentication working; phone auth disabled in simulator with user-friendly messaging
- âœ… Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- âœ… Clean architecture with proper separation of concerns

## Next Steps

1. âœ… ~~Complete authentication screens implementation~~ **DONE**
2. âœ… ~~Test authentication flow on both platforms with Firebase emulators~~ **DONE**
3. ðŸ“‹ **NEXT:** Implement profile form (stall name, market city, avatar upload)
4. ðŸ“‹ **NEXT:** Validate offline caching of profile in Hive
5. ðŸ“‹ **NEXT:** Begin media capture UI development
