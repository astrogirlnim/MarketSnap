## 🚨 **CURRENT CRITICAL ISSUE: Messaging Authentication Error**

**Current Status:** 🔄 **ACTIVE INVESTIGATION** - Permission denied error when starting new conversations

**Problem:** Users experience `[cloud_firestore/permission-denied]` error when trying to start a new conversation with a vendor, despite being properly authenticated.

**Context:**
- User is authenticated and has completed profile
- Vendor discovery works correctly (shows 4 test vendors)
- Error occurs when tapping on a vendor to start chat
- Should be able to start new conversations with any vendor

**Error Details:**
```
Error: [cloud_firestore/permission-denied] The caller does not have permission to execute the specified operation.
```

**Analysis Completed:**
1. ✅ Firestore rules are correct - allow authenticated users to read messages they're involved in
2. ✅ Firebase emulators running properly (Auth: 9099, Firestore: 8080)
3. ✅ User authentication verified - profile exists and user is signed in
4. ✅ Vendor data exists - 5 vendors including 4 test vendors
5. ❌ Test message creation failing - 0 messages in database despite script success
6. 🔄 Root cause: Empty conversation query authentication context issue

**Hypothesis:**
The issue occurs when `MessagingService.getConversationMessages()` queries for messages in a conversation that doesn't exist yet (new conversation). Even though the Firestore rules are correct, the query execution itself may have authentication context issues when no documents match.

**Implementation Status:**
- ✅ Chat screen with comprehensive error handling and authentication checks
- ✅ Vendor discovery with proper filtering and logging
- ✅ Message model with all required fields (conversationId, expiresAt, etc.)
- ❌ New conversation flow failing due to authentication context
- 🔄 Test data script issues preventing proper testing

**Next Actions:**
1. Investigate empty conversation query authentication context
2. Add detailed logging to identify exact failure point
3. Test simplified query structure for new conversations
4. Verify conversation ID generation logic
5. Create manual test for new conversation flow

**Files Involved:**
- `lib/features/messaging/presentation/screens/chat_screen.dart`
- `lib/core/services/messaging_service.dart`
- `firestore.rules`
- `scripts/setup_messaging_test_data.js`

   - ✅ Enhanced AuthService with CachedUser model for offline compatibility  
   - ✅ Cache authenticated user data across app restarts (30-day expiry)
   - ✅ Updated initialization order: HiveService before AuthService
   - ✅ Clear authentication cache on sign out
   - ❌ **BLOCKED**: Firebase Auth interface compatibility issue with _CachedFirebaseUser
   - ❌ Missing method implementations causing compilation failure

### 🚨 Current Blockers

#### Firebase Auth Interface Compatibility Issue
**Problem**: `_CachedFirebaseUser` class missing required method implementations
**Error**: 
```
The non-abstract class '_CachedFirebaseUser' is missing implementations for these members:
- User.linkWithProvider
- User.reauthenticateWithProvider
```

**Status**: Attempted fix by adding missing methods, but compilation still fails
**Next Steps**: 
1. Investigate Firebase Auth version compatibility
2. Consider alternative approach using wrapper pattern instead of implementing User interface
3. Explore using Firebase Auth's built-in persistence mechanisms

### 📝 Recent Changes (Last 24 Hours)

#### Enhanced Offline UX Implementation
- **connectivity_plus**: Added real-time network monitoring
- **Smart Posting Flow**: 10-second timeout online, instant queue offline  
- **Better Messaging**: "Will post when online" for offline state
- **Color-coded Feedback**: Context-aware UI states
- **Navigation Freedom**: Users can navigate away during posting

#### Offline Authentication Persistence (Attempted)
- **Hive Integration**: Added authCache box for persistent storage
- **CachedUser Model**: Simple model for offline authentication state
- **30-Day Expiry**: Automatic cache invalidation for security
- **Cross-restart Persistence**: Users remain logged in after app restart

### 🎯 Expected Offline Authentication Behavior (DOCUMENTED)

#### When User is Online and Authenticates
1. User completes phone/email verification successfully
2. Firebase Auth creates authenticated user session
3. AuthService caches user data in Hive (uid, email, phone, displayName, photoURL)
4. User can access all app features normally

#### When User Goes Offline (After Initial Authentication)
1. **Immediate Offline Access**: User remains authenticated using cached data
2. **Profile Access**: Local vendor profile data available from Hive
3. **Media Posting**: Photos/videos queue locally for upload when online
4. **Navigation**: Full app navigation remains functional
5. **Data Persistence**: Authentication state survives app restarts

#### When User Starts App Offline (Previously Authenticated)
1. **Cached Authentication**: AuthService loads cached user from Hive
2. **Validity Check**: Ensures cached data is < 30 days old
3. **Offline Mode**: App functions fully with local data
4. **Queue Processing**: Pending uploads remain queued until connectivity returns
5. **Profile Management**: Local profile editing continues to work

#### When User Tries to Authenticate While Offline
1. **Prevention**: Phone/email verification requires network connection
2. **Clear Messaging**: "Cannot verify while offline" error message
3. **Offline Indicator**: Visual indicator shows offline status
4. **Guidance**: User instructed to connect to internet for initial authentication

#### Security & Data Management
1. **30-Day Expiry**: Cached authentication expires after 30 days
2. **Sign Out**: Clears both Firebase session and local cache
3. **Data Sync**: Profile changes sync when connectivity returns
4. **Privacy**: No sensitive tokens stored locally, only basic user metadata

### 🔧 Technical Implementation Status

#### Working Components
- ✅ HiveService with authCache box
- ✅ AuthService offline state management
- ✅ Connectivity monitoring
- ✅ Cache expiry logic
- ✅ Sign out cache clearing

#### Blocked Components
- ❌ _CachedFirebaseUser interface implementation
