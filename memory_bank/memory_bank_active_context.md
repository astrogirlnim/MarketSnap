## Recent Changes (January 2025)

### **✅ Critical Database Corruption Bug Fix (January 25, 2025):**

**The Issue - App Crash on Startup:**
- **Symptoms:** Red error screen preventing app launch
- **Primary Error:** `HiveError: Cannot read, unknown typeId: 35. Did you forget to register an adapter?`
- **Secondary Error:** `LateInitializationError: Field 'vendorProfileBox' has not been initialized`
- **Impact:** Complete app failure - no functionality accessible

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- **TypeId Conflict:** Both `VendorProfile` and `PendingMediaItem` declared typeId: 1
- **Registration Logic Bug:** HiveService checked typeId 1 twice instead of checking typeId 3 for PendingMediaItem
- **Database Corruption:** Conflict created corrupted data with unknown typeId 35

**Comprehensive Solution Implemented:**
1. **Fixed TypeId Assignments:**
   ```dart
   @HiveType(typeId: 0) class UserSettings      // ✅ Correct
   @HiveType(typeId: 1) class VendorProfile     // ✅ Correct  
   @HiveType(typeId: 2) enum MediaType          // ✅ Correct
   @HiveType(typeId: 3) class PendingMediaItem  // ✅ Fixed: Changed from 1 to 3
   ```

2. **Fixed HiveService Registration Logic:**
   ```dart
   // Before (BUG):
   if (!Hive.isAdapterRegistered(1)) { // VendorProfile
   if (!Hive.isAdapterRegistered(1)) { // PendingMediaItem - WRONG!
   
   // After (FIXED):
   if (!Hive.isAdapterRegistered(1)) { // VendorProfile
   if (!Hive.isAdapterRegistered(3)) { // PendingMediaItem - CORRECT!
   ```

3. **Added Database Error Recovery:**
   - Created `_openBoxWithRecovery()` method to handle corrupted databases
   - Automatically deletes corrupted boxes and creates fresh ones
   - Graceful degradation with comprehensive logging

4. **Full Validation Process:**
   - ✅ `flutter analyze` - No issues found
   - ✅ `dart format` - Code formatting applied (2 files)
   - ✅ `dart fix --apply` - No additional fixes needed
   - ✅ `flutter build apk --debug` - Successful build
   - ✅ `flutter test` - All 11 tests passing
   - ✅ Runtime verification - App launches successfully

**Result:** App now launches successfully with all database operations working correctly. This was a critical production-blocking bug that has been completely resolved.

### **✅ iOS Google Auth Implementation & UI Fixes:**

**iOS Google Auth Issue Resolution:**
- **Problem:** Google Auth only working on Android, iOS users couldn't see Google Sign-In option
- **Root Cause:** Missing CFBundleURLTypes configuration in iOS Info.plist
- **Solution:** Added URL scheme configuration with proper REVERSED_CLIENT_ID
- **UI Fix:** Removed iOS-specific bypass that was hiding authentication method dialog
- **Result:** Full cross-platform Google Auth support with identical UX on both platforms

**UI Overflow Error Resolution:**
- **Problem:** RenderFlex overflow error in MediaReviewScreen SnackBar
- **Root Cause:** Success message text not wrapped in Expanded widget
- **Solution:** Added Expanded wrapper to prevent text overflow
- **Validation:** Applied comprehensive analysis pipeline (analyze, format, fix, build, test)
- **Result:** Clean UI rendering with no overflow errors

### **✅ Previous Critical Authentication Fixes:**

**OTP Verification Issue Resolution:**
- **Problem:** "Invalid verification code" errors when using correct codes from Firebase emulator
- **Root Cause:** Verification ID not updating when OTP codes were resent
- **Solution:** Added mutable `_currentVerificationId` to track active verification sessions
- **Result:** OTP verification now works reliably with resend functionality

**Account Linking System Implementation:**
- **Problem:** Different auth methods (Google vs Phone) created separate vendor profiles
- **Root Cause:** Each auth method generates different Firebase Auth UIDs
- **Solution:** Created AccountLinkingService to link accounts based on shared contact info
- **Result:** Prevents duplicate vendor profiles per user

**Sign-Out Spinner Fix:**
- **Problem:** Sign-out button spinning indefinitely
- **Root Cause:** Firebase Auth emulator connection timeouts without proper error handling
- **Solution:** Added 10-second timeout with enhanced error handling
- **Result:** Sign-out operations complete successfully

### **✅ Technical Improvements:**
- Enhanced logging throughout authentication flow for better debugging
- Updated VendorProfile model with phoneNumber and email fields
- Regenerated Hive type adapters for model changes
- Fixed Firestore emulator port from 8080 to 8081 to avoid conflicts
- Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- Added database corruption recovery mechanisms
- Complete code quality validation (analysis, formatting, linting, testing)
