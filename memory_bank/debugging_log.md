# Debugging Log - iOS Build Failures (Phase 1.2)

**Date:** June 24, 2025

## 1. Initial Issue: `flutter_secure_storage` Crash on iOS

After implementing the local storage layer (Phase 1.2), the application would build and run correctly on Android but failed immediately on the iOS simulator.

**Hypothesis:** The `flutter_secure_storage` package requires the **Keychain Sharing** capability to be enabled for the iOS application. This was missing from the default project configuration.

## 2. Resolution Steps

The resolution involved multiple steps to correctly configure the iOS project to use Keychain Sharing.

### Step 2.1: Create Entitlements File

- An entitlements file was created at `ios/Runner/Runner.entitlements`.
- This file defines the necessary keychain access group for the application, using the app's bundle identifier:
  ```xml
  <key>keychain-access-groups</key>
  <array>
    <string>$(AppIdentifierPrefix)com.example.marketsnap</string>
  </array>
  ```

### Step 2.2: Link Entitlements in Xcode Project

- The `ios/Runner.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` file was manually updated by the user to link the new entitlements file.
- The `CODE_SIGN_ENTITLEMENTS` build setting was set to `Runner/Runner.entitlements` for the `Debug`, `Profile`, and `Release` configurations.

### Step 2.3: Resolve Build Configuration Conflict

- **Secondary Issue:** After the project file was updated, a new, more subtle build error occurred.
- **Root Cause:** A previous attempt to solve the issue involved adding a `post_install` script to the `ios/Podfile` that *also* set the `CODE_SIGN_ENTITLEMENTS`. This created a conflict, as the setting was being defined in two different places.
- **Solution:** The redundant `post_install` script was removed from the `Podfile`, making the `.pbxproj` file the single source of truth for the configuration.

### Step 2.4: Update Xcode Workspace

- After cleaning the `Podfile`, the `pod install` command was run from the `ios` directory (preceded by `flutter pub get`) to regenerate a clean and correct Xcode workspace.

## 3. Final Outcome

With the `Runner.entitlements` file in place, the `.pbxproj` correctly configured, and the conflicting `Podfile` script removed, the iOS application now builds and runs successfully on the emulator. The local storage layer is fully functional on both Android and iOS.

## 4. Second Issue: `'Flutter/Flutter.h' File Not Found`

**Date:** June 24, 2025

Following the previous fixes, the iOS build began failing again with a persistent `Lexical or Preprocessor Issue (Xcode): 'Flutter/Flutter.h' file not found`. This error indicated that plugins (like `video_player_avfoundation`) could not locate the core Flutter framework headers during compilation.

### 4.1. Troubleshooting Steps

A series of standard troubleshooting steps were performed, none of which resolved the issue:
- **Podfile Check:** Verified `use_frameworks!` and `use_modular_headers!` were present.
- **XCConfig Check:** Ensured the `Pods-Runner.xcconfig` include was the first line in Flutter's `Debug.xcconfig` and `Release.xcconfig`.
- **Cache Cleaning:** Performed a comprehensive cleanup by removing `ios/Pods`, `ios/Podfile.lock`, `ios/Runner.xcworkspace`, the CocoaPods cache (`pod cache clean --all`), and Xcode's `DerivedData`.

Despite these actions, the error persisted, indicating a deeper project configuration problem.

### 4.2. Root Cause & Resolution

The root cause was an incomplete header search path configuration in the generated Xcode workspace. For projects with a mix of Swift and Objective-C pods, the framework search paths need to be explicitly declared.

- **Solution:** A `post_install` script was added to the `ios/Podfile`. This script iterates through all pod targets and explicitly adds the Flutter framework's directory to their `FRAMEWORK_SEARCH_PATHS`.

  ```ruby
  post_install do |installer|
    installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
      flutter_additional_ios_build_settings(target)
      target.build_configurations.each do |config|
        config.build_settings['FRAMEWORK_SEARCH_PATHS'] = [
          '$(inherited)',
          '${PODS_ROOT}/../Flutter'
        ]
      end
    end
  end
  ```

- **Finalization:** After adding the script, a final `flutter pub get` followed by `pod install` regenerated the Xcode workspace with the correct search paths embedded.

## 5. Final Outcome (Part 2)

The addition of the `FRAMEWORK_SEARCH_PATHS` script in the `Podfile` successfully resolved the header linking issue. The project now builds and runs correctly on both iOS and Android platforms, with all native plugins functioning as expected.

## 6. Third Issue: `the Dart compiler exited unexpectedly`

**Date:** June 24, 2025

**Symptom:** After a series of previous fixes, the iOS build would complete, the app would launch on the simulator, initialize some services (like Hive), and then immediately crash with the generic error `the Dart compiler exited unexpectedly.` and `Lost connection to device.`

### 6.1. Misleading Paths & Final Resolution

This issue was caused by a combination of two separate problems, one of which was inadvertently introduced during the debugging process itself.

1.  **Erroneous `Podfile` Change (Self-Inflicted):**
    - In an attempt to fix the build, the `post_install` script in the `ios/Podfile` was modified, removing the `FRAMEWORK_SEARCH_PATHS` addition.
    - **This was incorrect.** The `debugging_log.md` (specifically Section 4.2) clearly stated that this script was the *fix* for a previous `Flutter/Flutter.h` not found error. Removing it reintroduced the original header linking problem, which manifested as the generic Dart compiler crash at runtime.
    - **Resolution:** The `Podfile` was reverted to include the necessary `FRAMEWORK_SEARCH_PATHS` script.

2.  **Missing `Profile.xcconfig`:**
    - The `pod install` command consistently produced a warning: `CocoaPods did not set the base configuration of your project...` for the `profile` configuration.
    - **Root Cause:** The `ios/Flutter/` directory contained `Debug.xcconfig` and `Release.xcconfig`, but was missing a `Profile.xcconfig`. Flutter uses all three build modes, and CocoaPods was correctly generating a `Pods-Runner.profile.xcconfig` file but had nowhere to include it.
    - **Resolution:** A new file, `ios/Flutter/Profile.xcconfig`, was created with the required includes, silencing the warning and ensuring the Profile build configuration was correctly linked with its CocoaPods dependencies.

### 6.2. Final Fix Workflow

The successful resolution required a strict sequence of operations:
1.  Correcting the `ios/Podfile` `post_install` script.
2.  Creating the `ios/Flutter/Profile.xcconfig` file.
3.  Performing a full clean of the iOS project: `rm -rf ios/Pods ios/Podfile.lock ios/Runner.xcworkspace`.
4.  Reinstalling all dependencies: `flutter pub get` followed by `cd ios && pod install`.

After these steps, the application built and ran successfully on the iOS simulator, resolving the persistent runtime crash.
