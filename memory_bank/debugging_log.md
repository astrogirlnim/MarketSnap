# Debugging Log - iOS Build Failures (Phase 1.2)

**Date:** June 24, 2025

## 1. Initial Issue: `flutter_secure_storage` Crash on iOS

After implementing the local storage layer (Phase 1.2), the application would build and run correctly on Android but failed immediately on the iOS simulator.

**Hypothesis:** The `flutter_secure_storage` package requires the **Keychain Sharing** capability to be enabled for the iOS application. This was missing from the default project configuration.

## 2. Resolution Steps

The resolution involved multiple steps to correctly configure the iOS project to use Keychain Sharing.

### Step 2.1: Create Entitlements File

- An entitlements file was created at `ios/Runner/Runner.entitlements`.
- This file defines the necessary keychain access group for the application, using the app's bundle identifier:
  ```xml
  <key>keychain-access-groups</key>
  <array>
    <string>$(AppIdentifierPrefix)com.example.marketsnap</string>
  </array>
  ```

### Step 2.2: Link Entitlements in Xcode Project

- The `ios/Runner.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` file was manually updated by the user to link the new entitlements file.
- The `CODE_SIGN_ENTITLEMENTS` build setting was set to `Runner/Runner.entitlements` for the `Debug`, `Profile`, and `Release` configurations.

### Step 2.3: Resolve Build Configuration Conflict

- **Secondary Issue:** After the project file was updated, a new, more subtle build error occurred.
- **Root Cause:** A previous attempt to solve the issue involved adding a `post_install` script to the `ios/Podfile` that *also* set the `CODE_SIGN_ENTITLEMENTS`. This created a conflict, as the setting was being defined in two different places.
- **Solution:** The redundant `post_install` script was removed from the `Podfile`, making the `.pbxproj` file the single source of truth for the configuration.

### Step 2.4: Update Xcode Workspace

- After cleaning the `Podfile`, the `pod install` command was run from the `ios` directory (preceded by `flutter pub get`) to regenerate a clean and correct Xcode workspace.

## 3. Final Outcome

With the `Runner.entitlements` file in place, the `.pbxproj` correctly configured, and the conflicting `Podfile` script removed, the iOS application now builds and runs successfully on the emulator. The local storage layer is fully functional on both Android and iOS.
