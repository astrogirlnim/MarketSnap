### Phases Overview
- [X] **Phase 1:** Foundation  
- [X] **Phase 2:** Data Layer  
- [ ] **Phase 3:** Interface Layer  
- [~] **Phase 4:** Implementation Layer

## Phase 1 – Foundation  
**Criteria:** Essential build & tooling tasks with zero external dependencies.

- [X] **1. Flutter Project Bootstrap**
  - [X] Initialise Flutter 3 project with null‑safety enabled.
  - [X] Add core packages: `firebase_core`, `firebase_auth`, `cloud_firestore`, `firebase_storage`, `firebase_messaging`, `workmanager`, `hive`, `path_provider`, `image_picker`, `camera`, `video_player`, `video_compress`.
  - [X] Configure Android & iOS Firebase SDKs with staging project IDs.
  - [X] **Enable Google Auth as optional sign-in method in Firebase Auth and app UI.** ✅ Google sign-in is now available in the authentication dialog for dev and production.

- [X] **2. Local Data Stores**
  - [X] Create Hive boxes for `pendingMediaQueue` and `userSettings`.
  - [X] Implement encryption key generation & storage in secure storage.
  - [X] Write baseline unit test: enqueue/dequeue survives hot restart.

- [X] **3. WorkManager Jobs**
  - [X] Register background sync job (`SyncPendingMediaTask`).
  - [X] Configure exponential back‑off policy.
  - [X] Add unit test: task executes when connectivity changes. (Manual verification required on iOS; see README)

- [X] **4. Static Asset Pipeline**
  - [X] Add warm/cool/contrast LUT PNGs to asset bundle.
  - [X] Verify build size stays < 50 MB release APK/IPA.
  - [X] CI step: fail build if assets exceed limit.


---

## Phase 2 – Data Layer  
**Criteria:** Schemas, rules & serverless endpoints. *Depends on Phase 1.*

- [X] **1. Firestore Schema & Security**
  - [X] Define collections: `vendors`, `snaps`, `broadcasts`, `followers` with indexes.
  - [X] Write Firebase rules restricting each document to `request.auth.uid` vendor.
  - [X] Add emulator test verifying unauthenticated write is rejected.

- [X] **2. Storage Buckets**
  - [X] Create `/vendors/{uid}/snaps/` bucket path policy (max 1 MB object).
  - [X] Configure TTL lifecycle rule (30 days hard delete).

- [X] **3. Cloud Functions (Core)**
  - [X] `sendFollowerPush` – on `snaps` create → FCM multicast.
  - [X] `fanOutBroadcast` – on `broadcasts` create → FCM.
  - [X] Unit tests with Firebase Functions Test SDK.

- [X] **4. Cloud Functions (AI Phase 2 Prep)**
  - [X] Scaffold `generateCaption`, `getRecipeSnippet`, `vectorSearchFAQ` with dummy return.
  - [X] Environment var for OpenAI key; leave disabled flag until Phase 4.

- [X] **5. Messages & Notifications**
  - [X] Define `messages` collection with 24 h TTL composite index.
  - [X] Firestore security rules: only `fromUid` and `toUid` may read/write.
  - [X] Cloud Function `sendMessageNotification` – on new `messages` doc → FCM to recipient.

### Implementation Rules
- **Feature Independence:** each sub‑task is self‑contained, rollback‑safe, and unit‑tested.  
- **Parallelism:** Phase 1 first; Phases 2 & 3 can overlap; Phase 4 starts after Phase 1 complete.  
- **Status Markers:** `[ ]` Not Started  /   `[~]` In Progress  /   `[X]` Completed  /   `[!]` Blocked.

Copy this markdown into your tracker and tick items as you go. Happy building!

> **Note:**
> - Android: Background sync is fully functional and can be verified in-app.
> - iOS: Background sync is functional, but due to iOS platform limitations, execution must be verified via console logs. See the README for details.
