# MarketSnap Lite – Vendor User Stories

| # | User Story | Features Utilised |
|---|---|---|
| **1** | **Offline Photo Snap**<br>*As a farmers‑market vendor with spotty signal, I want to take a quick photo of today’s produce and see it land in a “Pending Upload” queue, so my post isn’t lost and shoppers are notified the moment I reconnect.* | Camera → Offline Snap Queue → Sync + Push Ping → Follower Feed |
| **2** | **5‑Second Video Teaser**<br>*As a vendor, I want to record a short 5‑sec clip showing fresh peaches being unloaded, auto‑compressed to ≤ 1 MB, and added to my story reel, so shoppers feel the freshness without draining anyone’s data.* | Video Capture & Compression → Offline Queue → Ephemeral Story Reel |
| **3** | **One‑Tap AI Caption & Filter**<br>*As a vendor who’s short on time, I want to tap “Magic Caption” to get a catchy line (“Sun‑kissed peaches—grab ’em fast!”) and apply a warm filter before posting, so my snap pops and I spend zero minutes writing.* | AI Caption Helper → Low‑Bandwidth Filters |
| **4** | **Location‑Tagged Snap**<br>*As a vendor setting up at a new market, I want to toggle “Show My Market Location” so my post displays a coarse city‑level pin, helping shoppers nearby discover my stall.* | Coarse Location Tag → Follower Feed discovery |
| **5** | **“Almost Gone” Broadcast**<br>*As my baskets start to empty, I want to send a short text blast (“Only 5 baskets left, $3 each!”) that expires in 6 h, nudging loyal followers to swing by before I sell out.* | Vendor Broadcast Text → Push Ping |
| **6** | **Recipe & FAQ Booster (Phase 2)**<br>*After posting a snap, I want to attach an AI‑suggested simple recipe link (“Peach Cobbler in 20 min”) and let shoppers tap a quick FAQ card (“Do you accept cards?”) so they get inspired and informed without asking me in person.* | AI Recipe Snippet → FAQ Cards (vector search) → Story Reel |
