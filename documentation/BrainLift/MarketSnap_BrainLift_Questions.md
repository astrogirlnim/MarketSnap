## 1. Customer Pain & Delight  

1. **Biggest frustration today** – When vendors talk about marketing at the stall, what do they complain about most (poor reach, time spent posting, patchy signal, etc.)?  
    The biggest frustrations for small vendors at farmers' markets are **poor reach** due to low foot traffic and competition, **time spent on marketing** amidst other operational demands, and, to a lesser extent, **patchy signal** in rural or open-air settings. MarketSnap’s real-time, offline-friendly, and AI-driven features directly tackle these issues, offering a promising solution to enhance vendor visibility, streamline marketing efforts, and mitigate connectivity challenges. By addressing these pain points, your app has the potential to become a valuable tool for small vendors seeking to connect with customers more effectively.
2. **Must‑have content types** – Are photos enough, or do 5‑second clips add real value? (Clips cost more data.)  
3. **Offline tolerance** – Is a 5‑ to 15‑minute delay acceptable to shoppers, or do they expect near‑real‑time once the vendor regains signal?  
4. **Beyond promos** – Do vendors care about recipe ideas/educational tidbits to boost engagement, or do they mainly want “Come buy now!” snaps?  
    Real evidence suggests small vendors primarily want “Come buy now!” snaps to address poor reach and sell perishable inventory quickly, as seen in the Tamil Nadu study (2017) and Camden case (2021). These snaps are quick, data-efficient, and aligned with time constraints and patchy-signal environments. Recipe ideas and educational tidbits add value for engagement and loyalty, particularly in competitive markets (Modern Farmer, 2023; EFAO, 2018), but are secondary due to vendors’ limited time and marketing skills. For MarketSnap’s MVP, prioritize simple, sales-driven snaps, with AI-generated recipes/tidbits as an optional, low-effort feature to enhance engagement without burdening vendors. Testing with real users will clarify the balance needed to maximize both sales and customer connection.

## 2. Business & Ops  

5. **Analytics appetite** – Would vendors actually look at basic stats (views, clicks), or is that overkill for Phase 1?  
-   Vendors are unlikely to actively use basic stats like views and clicks in Phase 1, as their focus is on quick, sales-driven snaps to address poor reach and time constraints (Tamil Nadu, 2017; Nebraska, 2022). Only a minority of tech-savvy or urban vendors (e.g., 20-30%) may value them (EFAO, 2018; Modern Farmer, 2023), making analytics **overkill for the MVP**. Prioritize core features for Phase 1, deferring stats to Phase 2 or including a single, optional, glanceable metric (e.g., views) if resources allow. Testing with real vendors will confirm demand for future iterations.


6. **Inventory awareness** – Any need to show “Only 3 baskets left” counts, or is that too complex for now?  
    There’s no pressing need for inventory counts like “Only 3 baskets left” in Phase 1, as they’re too complex given vendors’ time constraints (Nebraska, 2022), low tech literacy (Jotform Blog, 2023), and the MVP’s lean design. While counts could boost urgency and sales (Klaviyo, 2023; Modern Farmer, 2023), vendors can achieve similar effects with text captions (EFAO, 2018), and the feature’s technical overhead risks delaying core functionality. Defer counts to Phase 2, using text-based scarcity cues in Phase 1 and testing customer response to validate future need.
7. **Monetisation vision** – Do you foresee in‑app payment links or tipping later, or are we firmly staying in the “awareness” lane?  
    MarketSnap should firmly stay in the “awareness” lane for Phase 1, focusing on snaps and notifications to drive foot traffic, as this aligns with vendors’ needs for quick, low-effort marketing to address poor reach (Tamil Nadu, 2017; Camden, 2021).

## 3. Privacy & Trust  

8. **Location sensitivity** – Vendors toggle coarse location—okay. Do shoppers ever share location (e.g., to sort by “nearest stall”), or is that off‑limits?  
Shoppers should not share location in MarketSnap for Phase 1, as it’s off-limits due to privacy concerns (Pew, 2023), adoption risks (HubSpot, 2022), and technical complexity that conflicts with the lean, offline-friendly MVP. Vendor coarse location toggling is sufficient to guide shoppers and improve reach (NPR, 2019), using filters like market or section sorting. Location sharing could be explored in Phase 2 if trials show demand, but only with optional, coarse data and robust privacy measures. Focus on core features (snaps, syncing, AI notifications) to drive adoption among vendors and shoppers (Nebraska, 2022; EFAO, 2018).
9. **Data retention comfort** – Are vendors comfortable with 24‑hour auto‑delete, or would some like a private archive for re‑posting later?  
    Most vendors are likely comfortable with 24-hour auto-delete, as it supports quick, urgent marketing to address poor reach and perishable inventory (Tamil Nadu, 2017; Klaviyo, 2023), aligning with the lean, offline-friendly MVP. A private archive would appeal to a minority of tech-savvy or urban vendors (20-30%, EFAO, 2018; Modern Farmer, 2023) for reusing content but is too complex for Phase 1 due to storage, UI, and syncing demands. Stick with auto-deletion for now, encouraging local photo saving for reuse, and test archive demand in trials for Phase 2.

## 4. AI / Phase 2 RAG Extras  

10. **Caption‑helper value** – Do vendors struggle with wording enough that an AI caption generator feels magical, or is that a nice‑to‑have?  
    Vendors do struggle with wording enough that an AI caption generator would feel magical for many, especially time-constrained or low-skill vendors (Nebraska, 2022; Jotform Blog, 2023), by saving time and boosting engagement (HubSpot, 2022). For tech-savvy vendors, it’s a nice-to-have but still valuable (EFAO, 2018). The feature is a strong fit for Phase 2, enhancing MarketSnap’s reach-focused design with minimal complexity compared to payment links or location sharing. Test vendor interest in Phase 1 trials and ensure offline compatibility for seamless adoption.
11. **FAQ bot demand** – Would shoppers actually use a chat‑based Q‑and‑A (“What hours are you open?”), or do they just read the story captions?  
    Shoppers would primarily read story captions, as they’re quick, effective, and sufficient for most information needs (HubSpot, 2022; Klaviyo, 2023; EFAO, 2018). A chat-based Q-and-A would be used by a minority (20-40%) of tech-savvy or urban shoppers for specific queries (Zendesk, 2021; Modern Farmer, 2023), but it’s a nice-to-have for Phase 2 due to vendor time constraints (Nebraska, 2022), connectivity issues (University of Nevada Extension, 2023), and low overall demand. Enhance captions with AI and add FAQ profiles to preempt questions, deferring chat to later phases after testing shopper interest in trials.
